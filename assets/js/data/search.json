This year turned into a full evolution: network upgrades, compute refreshes, storage testing, and a bunch of power/UPS changes that change how I run (and recover) everything. Self-hosting guide next - subscribe for the follow up. Watch the video The wall of tech (everything that doesn’t fit the rack) Before we even touch the rack, let’s start with the wall stuff that keeps everything running: Internet coming in: I have two fiber lines coming to the house - one buried line coming in from the front, and one coming in from the back of the house overhead/from the pole - but I’ve fully switched to one provider as the primary which is Quantum Internet. Old fiber ONT: my previous fiber gear is still here, but currently unplugged. USI, while great, is twice the price and half the speed of Quantum. I used them for years, and a great service, but I am able to have fiber internet with Quantum + T-Mobile 5G Home Internet as a backup for the same price. USI needs to lower their price now that they have real competition. Backup internet (5G): my backup right now is T-Mobile Home Internet over 5G - it’s cheaper than keeping a second fiber line, and it’s already failed over a few times without issues when my primary internet goes down. I was also hoping to use it with the UniFi 5G Max, but the SIM is locked to T-Mobile’s gateway. UniFi phone: mounted on a 3D-printed bracket from earlier testing (I don’t run UniFi Talk full time, I was only testing it). Hue hubs (yes, four): I still run multiple Hue hubs because of Hue Play - I have three Play setups, and each one needs its own hub. Small PoE switch (wall): PoE powers a small switch on the wall, which the Hue hubs connect through. Whole-home wiring: this is where all the home cable runs land; it’s older Cat5e, punched down and still doing the job (yes, even for 10Gb in places). The wall of tech Power outages: coordinated shutdown One of the most important reliability pieces I have in place is what happens when the power goes out. This Raspberry Pi was already here last year, still running NUT Server and talking to multiple UPS units over USB (all the USB cables you see plugged in). The goal is a controlled, coordinated shutdown (instead of hoping everything survives). Raspberry Pi running NUT Server Small note: if you’re rotating SSH keys with Ansible, add the new key first, make sure you can log in, then remove the old one - ask me how I know 🤦. Backup DNS My Pi Zero was also here last year, still running Pi-hole as backup DNS if the rack is down. Pi Zero running Pi-hole for backup DNS OTA TV An HDHomeRun provides over-the-air TV, connected into Plex for DVR/live TV. HDHomeRun for OTA TV Wall power + battery backup This whole wall is powered by power strips and backed up by a UPS, so all of this wall gear stays online when power flickers. Wall UPS keeping the wall gear online Zigbee, IoT, and the “make dumb stuff smart” corner A few highlights from the wall-side automation gear: Broadlink: used for RF control to make a dumb ceiling fan act smart (including “remembering” its last state via automation). SMLIGHT (SLZB-06): running as my Zigbee coordinator, with ~80+ Zigbee devices (leak sensors, switches, motion sensors, etc.). UniFi Sensor (test gear): a UniFi motion sensor I was testing. UniFi SuperLink: testing UniFi’s closed sensor ecosystem (environment sensor + motion sensor). UniFi Siren: PoE powered; I’d love to tie this into smoke alarm / alerting in the future. Zigbee, IoT, and the ‘make dumb stuff smart’ corner - Broadlink, SMLIGHT coordinator, UniFi sensors The rack (network, storage, compute, and control) The core switch upgrade UniFi USW Pro XG 48 PoE The big upgrade on the network side. 48 ports total (mix of 10GbE and 2.5GbE) All PoE+++ 25Gb uplink ports (I’m using multiple uplinks/LAG to the gateway) It’s also the first UniFi switch I’ve owned where I can actually hear the fan under load - not super loud, just noticeable when it’s moving air. USW Pro XG 48 PoE with dark-mode LEDs USW Pro XG 48 PoE with standard LED lighting Gateway + core uplinks UniFi EFG (25Gb gateway) This is my core gateway and it’s way more than I need, but it gives me tons of headroom. One reason this does make sense for my setup is that I can keep IDS/IPS turned on and still push around ~13 Gb/s, so I’m not forced to pick between security features and performance. USW Pro XG Aggregation (25Gb) This is the core aggregation switch upgrade that ties the backbone together and lets me build out faster uplinks through the rack. It’s also where all of my 10G links from the servers connect, and it’ll be a great down the road if/when I run fiber through the house. USW Pro XG Aggregation - 25Gb backbone connecting all servers Remote power + clean cable paths USB PDU Pro: makes it easy to power-cycle individual devices remotely. I’m still working on cable cleanup - brush panels, cable routing, and making the front of the rack as clean as possible while still making efficient use of the space I have. UniFi PDU Pro for remote power cycling and individual outlet management Storage + cameras (keep it local) UniFi UNVR (local Protect recordings) My camera footage stays local on the UNVR. It’s set up with four 8TB drives in RAID 5. I can get about 2 months of 24/7 recordings on 12 cameras. I love Protect and not relying on the cloud. UPS strategy I split UPS power into two buckets - networking and servers. 1U Eaton UPS (networking + PoE) The 1U Eaton UPS is dedicated to all of the networking gear, so my network can stay up independently from my servers. It also backs up the PoE switch, which keeps a lot of devices around the house online during an outage - access points, cameras, other switches, and more. 1U Eaton UPS - dedicated networking and PoE backup Tripp Lite UPS + battery extension (servers) The big UPS at the bottom powers the servers. It’s a Tripp Lite with an external battery pack, and I typically see anywhere from ~60 to 100 minutes of runtime depending on the load. Tripp Lite UPS with external battery pack Tripp Lite UPS display showing estimated runtime Proxmox cluster (compute + Kubernetes) I’m still running a Proxmox cluster on a set of Intel NUCs. Clustered for a single pane of glass and easy migrations Kubernetes nodes inside Proxmox (plus VMs/LXCs for various workloads) Intel NUC Proxmox cluster - running Kubernetes and various workloads JetKVM row (remote console) A whole row of JetKVMs gives me remote keyboard/video/mouse access over the network. I have six of them in the rack, and they’re connected to six machines so I can get console access without dragging a monitor and keyboard around. Six JetKVMs for remote console access to rack machines UniFi AI + controller AI Key + AI Port AI Key: adds smarter detections and summaries on top of Protect events (classify/describe/transcribe). AI Port: enables AI events on older or third-party cameras that can’t do it natively. UniFi Cloud Key (controller) An older Cloud Key I keep around for testing other UniFi apps (since the EFG only runs the UniFi Network App). The drive died, so I swapped it to an SSD. Mini test box Beelink EQ14 My small “test box” for containers - especially when I need to test Intel QuickSync. 3D-printed rack housing the UniFi AI Key and Beelink EQ14 Storage testing UniFi UNAS Pro 4 (video coming soon) I’ve been testing this device for a long time, and I’ll show how I’m using it in a future video. It’s loaded with four 20TB drives in RAID 5. One shelf (GPU + mini boxes) These three live together on a shelf: MinisForum MS-A1 + RTX 3090 (Oculink): used for testing that needs a dedicated GPU (including local AI testing/tutorials). Beelink ME Mini: all-NVMe box that I like more as an app/Proxmox/LXC server than a traditional NAS. Beelink ME Pro: a quiet hybrid mini NAS (NVMe + SATA) in an all meta case. If I ever had to shrink the homelab, it’d probably come down to “bulk storage + app server + one flexible compute box,” and these smaller systems have been great for testing that idea. Beelink ME Mini - all-NVMe compact server Beelink ME Pro - quiet hybrid mini NAS (NVMe + SATA) 1U Supermicro server (new build, video coming soon) This is a “new to me” 1U Supermicro server. It’s older hardware, but it checked all the boxes I needed: 1U, lots of drive bays, and IPMI. It’s running an Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4, has 16GB DDR4, and four 22TB Exos drives. Storinator (big plans) This is the 45Drives Storinator AV60. Right now it’s powered off, but it’s one of the bigger “next steps” in the rack. The plan is to rebuild it around an EPYC CPU that Wendell sent me, but I’ve been holding off because DDR5 (and the board I want) has been hard to justify and hard to find. As soon as the parts situation calms down, I’m going to gut it and bring it back online. Storinator AV60 - future EPYC rebuild 45Drives HL15 (all-in-one TrueNAS refresh) My HL15 has changed a lot this year. The goal was to build a better all-in-one system (since new builds and parts are annoying right now), so I upgraded this box pretty heavily: 10x 14TB drives for bulk storage 256GB DDR (slots are maxed out) A better CPU (a Platinum upgrade from Patrick at Serve The Home) Noctua 120mm fans, a Noctua Xeon cooler, and a Seasonic PRIME 1600W Noctua Edition PSU More NVMe (including adapters to convert M.2 to U.2, and Oculink into PCIe lanes) An NVIDIA RTX A2000 inside the chassis for the workloads that need it It’s running TrueNAS with ZFS. Right now it’s set up as mirrored pairs, but I’m planning to revisit the ZFS layout to trade some IOPS for more usable capacity and resiliency. HL15 loaded with drives for bulk storage, GPU, and NVMe HL15 overhead view - all RAM slots filled Backup internet (5G) I’m using T-Mobile Home Internet over 5G as my backup link, and it’s already saved me a few times during outages. The annoying part is that the SIM is locked to their gateway, which makes it impossible to use with the UniFi 5G Max. I really hope T-Mobile allows this or UniFi comes up with a way for us to use T-Mobile Home Internet with this device. UniFi 5G Max with T-Mobile SIM as backup internet What’s next I’ll have a video soon on how I back up my servers. I’ve also got another video coming that walks through the services running on all of these machines, and how I spread workloads across the rack. 📦 Gear list (affiliate) Rack &amp; Accessories 32u Rack 1u Brush Panels 1u Rack Mount Full Depth Shelf Right Angle Extension Cord UniFi Power Distribution Pro Network Patch Panel Wall Mount Patch Panel UniFI EFG UniFi Flex Mini UniFi Flex 2.5 Mini UniFi Fortress Gateway UniFi Pro XG 48 PoE UniFi USW Pro XG Aggregation Servers &amp; Accessories UniFi UNAS Pro 4 UniFi UNVR MinisForum MS-A1 Beelink EQ 14 HL15 14 TB Exos Seagate Drives 20 TB Exos Seagate Drives 22 TB Exos Seagate Drives Noctua 120mm fans Seasonic PRIME 1600W Noctua Edition PSU Noctua NH-U12S DX-4677 for Xeon NVIDIA RTX A2000 IoT &amp; Sensors UniFi SuperLink UniFi Sensor (motion) UniFi Sensor (environment) UniFi Siren Broadlink RM4 Pro PoE Zigbee Adapter SMLIGHT SLZB-06 Smart ZigBee LED Controller Hue Light Strip Hue Motion &amp; Temp Hue Smart Bulb Starter Kit Cloud Lamp Other gear mentioned JetKVM UniFi AI Key UniFi AI Port UniFi Cloud Key+ UniFi Talk Phone UniFi 5G Max Raspberry Pi (NUT Server) Raspberry Pi Zero (Pi-hole) Accessories Wall Control Galvanized Steel Pegboard Eaton 5P1500R UPS Tripp Lite 2200VA 1920W UPS Smart 2U Rackmount Tripp Lite BP36V15-2U Smart UPS 36V 2U Rackmount External Battery Pack APC 1500VA UPS APC 600 VA UPS Wall Power Strip Fire Extinguisher Over the Air TV Gear HDHomeRun Network Tuner TV Tuner that supports 4K and up to 4 streams Indoor Outdoor Antenna LTE / 5G Filter Antenna Splitter with Passthrough Intel NUC Mini Cluster Intel NUC 11 Intel NUC 12 SAMSUNG 980 PRO SSD 1TB PCIe NVMe SAMSUNG 870 EVO SATA G.Skill RipJaws DDR4 SO-DIMM Series 32GB Rackmount Kit Mk1 Manufacturing (Affiliate links may be included in this post.

The Beelink ME Pro stood out to me because it’s small, quiet, easy to work on, and it has a really nice mix of hardware for the money: 5GbE + 2.5GbE, three NVMe slots, two SATA bays, 12GB LPDDR5. In this video, I set it up the way I’d actually use it: bulk storage on SATA, fast NVMe for apps/containers, real SMB transfers, and a Plex hardware transcode check. Watch the video Where to buy Beelink ME Pro — Amazon (affiliate) Beelink ME Pro — Beelink store (non-affiliate) What the ME Pro is Think of the ME Pro as a tiny NAS style mini PC that’s meant to be opened up. A few things you’ll notice right away: Mostly-metal chassis Magnetic top cover for quick access Tray-based design (easy to service) Dual NICs (2.5G + 5G) Storage layout that actually makes sense for “bulk + fast apps” The setup I used Beelink sent the N95 config: Intel N95 (4C/4T, up to 3.4GHz) 12GB LPDDR5 512GB SSD (system drive) I added: 2× SATA HDDs for bulk storage (mirror) 2× NVMe SSDs for a fast app pool (mirror) Quick tour On the front: USB‑C and the power button. On the back: 2.5G + 5G Ethernet, HDMI, USB, USB‑C (supports a display), and a 3.5mm audio jack. That dual NIC combo is still not super common under $400. Installing drives (best part) This is where the ME Pro differentiates itself in terms of design. The top vent/mesh cover is magnetic The tool is stored underneath (so you don’t go hunting for it) Drive trays include rubber bumpers The trays also have thermal pads so heat can move into the chassis And yes, they include an extra screw. Thank you. OS and why I used TrueNAS I used TrueNAS SCALE as my real world test. I had a quick install issue with an older Ventoy stick, so I just flashed a normal installer USB and installed the latest TrueNAS SCALE. I went with TrueNAS SCALE for this build because it’s what I’m most familiar with right now. I’m sure this box would work fine with Unraid too, I just didn’t test it in this video. Quick install note: if you’re using Ventoy, make sure your Ventoy USB is up to date. I ran into a boot issue with an older Ventoy build, so I just flashed a standard USB Installer with Etcher and moved on. Storage layout: slow + fast I created two pools: slow: mirrored SATA HDD pool (bulk storage) fast: mirrored NVMe pool (apps/containers) This is the same pattern I use on a lot of home servers: big drives for media/backups fast SSDs for apps, databases, containers, and anything latency sensitive SMB shares + copy tests I created two SMB shares: slow movies (HDD pool) fast movies (NVMe pool) Then I copied the same large files to both. The HDD mirror landed right where I expected, solid performance and really close to on 2.5Gb/s (due to HDD speed), but it’s not the kind of speed that’s anywhere near 5GbE. The NVMe pool is where you really see the benefit of 5GbE. In my testing it was hovering around ~4.1 - 4.2 Gb/s (peaking around ~4.19 Gb/s), so not perfectly pinned at 5GbE, but still really fast. Apps + Plex Once I confirmed the NVMe pool was actually fast, I used it for apps. Then I installed Plex, mounted the media share, and verified hardware transcoding. Intel Quick Sync is a perfect for a box like this: small, efficient, and it can transcode on the fly without hammering the CPU. I also used intel_gpu_top to confirm the iGPU was doing the work. Where it fits (value) This market is crowded, so value matters. A lot of boxes under $400 are either: “appliance NAS” (great UI/ecosystem, less flexible) budget hardware (often 2.5GbE, fewer fast storage options) barebones DIY (you’re still adding RAM and a boot drive) The ME Pro is different because it gives you a lot in one tiny box: 5GbE + 2.5GbE 3× NVMe + 2× SATA quiet, serviceable design LPDDR5 already included If you want a simple appliance NAS, you might still prefer a traditional ecosystem. But if you want a small, efficient box with 2 drive bays that can do NAS stuff and run apps/containers on fast storage, the ME Pro might make sense. Wrapping up This one was fun to test. If you’re considering a small, low power NAS, the ME Pro stands out because it’s compact, quiet, and has a lot of the stuff homelab people care about. 🤝 Support the channel and help keep this site ad-free 🛍️ Check out all merch: https://shop.technotim.com/" }, { "title": "Self-Hosted Paperless-ngx + Optional Local AI: Private Documents and Improves OCR & Search (Full Setup)", "url": "/posts/paperless-ngx-local-ai/", "categories": "homelab", "tags": "paperless, paperless-ngx, docker, self-hosted, ollama, open-webui, paperless-ai, paperless-gpt, ocr, ai, privacy", "date": "2026-01-27 07:00:00 -0600", "content": "Build a complete Paperless-ngx stack in Docker and take control of your documents. We’ll get Paperless running first (works great on its own), then optionally add local AI with Ollama + Open WebUI and upgrade OCR using Paperless-GPT and Paperless-AI for more accurate, searchable text and tags - no cloud required. This post walks through a complete, repeatable Docker Compose for Paperless-ngx, plus an optional local AI layer that runs entirely on your own hardware. Paperless-ngx works great without AI. The AI pieces are optional add-ons you can easily disable by commenting out those parts in the stack. Watch the video What Paperless-ngx Is Paperless-ngx is a self-hosted document inbox that: Ingests scans and PDFs (via upload, a “consume” folder, or even apps) Runs OCR so documents become searchable Organizes using tags, correspondents, and document types Lets you search your archive like a personal document index If you want to keep personal paperwork (tax docs, medical, contracts, receipts) under your control, Paperless is the way to go. What We’re Building This stack is intentionally “batteries included” and breaks up parts of the backend into their own services, yet still easy to run. Core services Paperless-ngx – the document scanning and index system Postgres – database backend Redis – queue/cache Gotenberg – document conversion (Office/Excel → PDF, etc.) Tika – text extraction helpers Optional local AI services Ollama – local model runtime Open WebUI – model management + testing UI + chat Paperless-AI – metadata suggestions (tags/titles/etc.) Paperless-GPT – vision-model OCR + metadata suggestions Optional utility Dozzle – lightweight log viewer, highly recommended for container troubelshooting Document flow Data flow (no AI): Documents → Paperless-ngx → OCR/index/search Data flow (optional AI): Paperless-ngx ↔ (Paperless-AI / Paperless-GPT) ↔ Ollama Paperless stores and indexes your docs. Ollama runs the LLMs locally. Paperless-AI / Paperless-GPT are add-ons that call Ollama and write results back to Paperless. AI can enhance correspondents, tags, and text recognition (OCR) Prerequisites A Linux server (VM, mini PC, NAS — really anything that can run Docker) Docker + Docker Compose Optional but recommended for vision OCR: (an NVIDIA GPU) If using an NVIDIA GPU, be sure you have the proper drivers and NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed You can run Docker with a GPU other than NVIDIA, though some extra configuration is needed Ports Used in This Guide This is the exact port map used in the stack below: Service Port URL Paperless-ngx 8000 http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:8000 Paperless-AI 3000 http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:3000 Open WebUI 3001 http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:3001 Paperless-GPT 3002 http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:3002 Dozzle (logs) 8080 http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:8080 Docker Compose Stack Everything runs from a single Compose file. I keep a separate .env per service so secrets stay scoped to only services that need them. I’m not going to paste every .env file inline here (it gets long fast). Instead, the repository includes copy/paste-ready .env files for each service. Complete configuration + files: https://github.com/timothystewart6/paperless-stack Compose file Create a compose.yaml file in a folder like paperless-stack and place the contents of the compose file: services: # paperless-ngx main service paperless: image: ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest container_name: paperless-ngx restart: unless-stopped env_file: - ./paperless/.env depends_on: - postgres - redis - gotenberg - tika ports: - \"8000:8000\" volumes: - ./paperless/data:/usr/src/paperless/data - ./paperless/media:/usr/src/paperless/media - ./paperless/export:/usr/src/paperless/export - ./paperless/consume:/usr/src/paperless/consume # postgres database for paperless-ngx postgres: image: postgres:18 restart: unless-stopped container_name: postgres env_file: - ./postgres/.env volumes: - ./postgres/data:/var/lib/postgresql # redis database for paperless-ngx redis: image: docker.io/library/redis:8 container_name: redis restart: unless-stopped env_file: - ./redis/.env volumes: - ./redis/data:/data # gotenberg service that paperless uses for document conversion gotenberg: image: docker.io/gotenberg/gotenberg:8.25 container_name: gotenberg env_file: - ./gotenberg/.env restart: unless-stopped command: - \"gotenberg\" - \"--chromium-disable-javascript=true\" - \"--chromium-allow-list=file:///tmp/.*\" # tika service that paperless uses for document text extraction tika: image: docker.io/apache/tika:latest container_name: tika restart: unless-stopped env_file: ./tika/.env # open-webui service for LLM interaction open-webui: image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:latest container_name: open-webui restart: unless-stopped env_file: - ./open-webui/.env depends_on: - ollama ports: - \"3001:8080\" volumes: - ./open-webui/data:/app/backend/data # ollama service for local LLMs ollama: image: ollama/ollama:latest container_name: ollama env_file: - ./ollama/.env volumes: - ./ollama/data/:/root/.ollama - ./ollama/models:/ollama-models restart: unless-stopped deploy: resources: reservations: devices: - driver: nvidia count: all capabilities: [gpu] # paperless-ai service paperless-ai: image: clusterzx/paperless-ai:latest container_name: paperless-ai restart: unless-stopped depends_on: - ollama - paperless ports: - \"3000:3000\" env_file: - ./paperless-ai/.env volumes: - ./paperless-ai/data:/app/data # paperless-gpt service paperless-gpt: image: icereed/paperless-gpt:latest container_name: paperless-gpt restart: unless-stopped depends_on: - ollama - paperless ports: - \"3002:8080\" env_file: - ./paperless-gpt/.env volumes: - ./paperless-gpt/prompts:/app/prompts # optional but helpful log viewer dozzle: image: amir20/dozzle:latest restart: unless-stopped container_name: dozzle env_file: - ./dozzle/.env volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock - ./dozzle/data:/data ports: - \"8080:8080\" Without local AI If you don’t want your stack to use local AI, comment out or remove: open-webui ollama paperless-ai paperless-gpt Create the folder structure If you’re using bind mounts (like this stack does), it’s nice to create the folder structure up front so Docker doesn’t create directories as root. mkdir -p \\ paperless/{data,media,export,consume} \\ postgres/data \\ redis/data \\ gotenberg \\ tika \\ paperless-ai/data \\ open-webui/data \\ ollama/{data,models} \\ paperless-gpt/prompts \\ dozzle/data Project layout Here’s the folder/file layout used in this guide, with the project root named paperless-stack: paperless-stack/ ├── docker-compose.yml ├── dozzle/ │ ├── .env │ └── data/ ├── gotenberg/ │ ├── .env ├── ollama/ │ ├── .env │ ├── data/ │ └── models/ ├── open-webui/ │ ├── .env │ └── data/ ├── paperless/ │ ├── .env │ ├── consume/ │ ├── data/ │ ├── export/ │ └── media/ ├── paperless-ai/ │ ├── .env │ └── data/ ├── paperless-gpt/ │ ├── .env │ └── prompts/ ├── postgres/ │ ├── .env │ └── data/ ├── redis/ │ ├── .env │ └── data/ └── tika/ └── .env Step 1 — Start Everything Inside of the folder with your compose file: docker compose up -d If you want to watch logs while services come up: docker compose logs -f Or open Dozzle at http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:8080. Step 2 — Set Up Paperless-ngx Open Paperless: http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:8000 Create your admin account and sign in. At this point, Paperless-ngx is fully functional without any AI. You can upload documents and start building your library. Step 3 — Optional: Local AI Backend (Ollama + Open WebUI) If you want local AI features, start by confirming Ollama is running and then use Open WebUI to pull a model. Open WebUI: http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:3001 Pull a model In Open WebUI: Admin Panel → Settings → Models A good lightweight model to start with: llama3.2:3b Once it’s downloaded, do a quick chat test to confirm it responds. If you’re using a GPU other than NVIDIA, you’ll need to update your .env and docker compose accordingly. Step 4 — Optional: Paperless-AI (Tagging/Titles/Metadata) Paperless-AI needs an API token from Paperless. Create a Paperless API token In Paperless: Profile → API Tokens → Generate Copy the token and place it in your paperless-ai/.env. Then restart: docker compose restart Open Paperless-AI: http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:3000 Create an account and confirm it can connect to Paperless. Step 5 — Optional: Paperless-GPT (Vision OCR + Metadata) This is the piece that made the biggest difference for me. OCR is night and day. Paperless-GPT can run OCR using a vision-capable LLM (via Ollama), which can be dramatically more accurate on certain scans than traditional OCR. Be sure a vision model like minicpm-v:8b is set in your .env You will also need to download this model for Ollama using Open WebUI http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:3001 In Admin Panel → Settings → Models, pull down model minicpm-v:8b Open Paperless-GPT: http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:3002 How Paperless-GPT finds documents Paperless-GPT watches for tags. Add a tag like paperless-gpt-ocr-auto (or your configured tag) to a document in Paperless, and it will show up in the Paperless-GPT UI. Manual OCR test Open a document in Paperless Copy the document ID from the URL In Paperless-GPT, go to OCR and run a job using that ID Save the result back to the document Now check the Paperless Content tab — the extracted text should be far more accurate and actually searchable. Automate OCR with Workflows If you want OCR to happen automatically, create a Paperless workflow that applies tags on upload. Example workflow: Trigger: On document added Action: Add tags: paperless-gpt-auto paperless-gpt-ocr-auto Once those tags are applied, Paperless-GPT can automatically process new documents. This will process both tags and content (OCR) Security Note: Remote Access Paperless contains personal documents. I recommend using a VPN for remote access rather than exposing this directly to the internet. The same goes for all other services in this stack. Troubleshooting A few common checks: It doesn’t work: open Dozzle at http://&lt;server-ip&gt;:8080 and read the logs. Paperless won’t load: docker compose ps and check logs for paperless AI add-ons can’t connect: verify URLs are using Compose service names (like http://paperless:8000) when running inside Docker Models are slow: start with a small model, and consider GPU acceleration for vision OCR Nothing shows in Paperless-GPT: confirm the correct tag is applied to a document in Paperless Summary With this you now have: A full self-hosted document archive with OCR + search A repeatable Docker Compose deployment Optional local AI features that doesn’t depend on the cloud Vision-model OCR (via Paperless-GPT) for improved text extraction on tough scans 🤝 Support the channel and help keep this site ad-free 🛍️ Check out all merch: https://shop.technotim.com/ ⚙️ See all the hardware I recommend at https://l.technotim.com/gear" }, { "title": "UniFi Travel Router: My Network Follows Me", "url": "/posts/unifi-travel-router/", "categories": "homelab", "tags": "unifi, utr, travel-router, teleport, wireguard, vpn, networking", "date": "2025-12-29 07:00:00 -0600", "content": "When you travel with multiple devices (and especially if you’re traveling with family), the WiFi setup is never just “connect once and move on.” It’s the phone, the laptop, the tablet, the other laptop, and then you’re playing tech support before you’ve even unpacked.

That gives you: Less device-by-device WiFi setup Isolation from public WiFi A clean place to apply VPN/tunneling (instead of configuring VPN clients on every device) Why I care about this (I’ve been chasing it for years) I’ve been chasing the “perfect travel router” for a long time. I started by carrying a basic home router with me. Then I went full DIY and built a travel setup that was basically a mobile homelab - maximum flexibility and a fun learning project, but also more complexity than I want to deal with when on short trips where I just want things to work. The UTR is interesting because it’s aiming for grab-and-go without giving up the UniFi workflow. Setup: claim → uplink → bind → broadcast Setup is one of the best parts. Once you power it on, you can claim it through the UniFi Network mobile app. The UTR shows up in Site Manager because it doesn’t belong to a site yet - which makes sense. From there: Choose how you want WAN Bind the UTR to the UniFi site you want to connect back to Choose which WiFi network you want the UTR to broadcast For my setup, I bind it to my home site, pick my home SSID, and let the UTR bring up a Teleport VPN (WireGuard) tunnel automatically. Once the SSID is broadcasting, your devices see a familiar network and automatically connect. Performance notes (what I saw) I ran speed tests across the three main ways I’d use the UTR. WiFi uplink (WiFi-as-WAN) When the UTR is using WiFi uplink and serving your client devices, it’s doing “double duty.” In my testing I saw roughly 100–250 Mbps up/down. Wired WAN Once I plugged into the WAN port and took that load off WiFi, speeds jumped to ~300–400 Mbps. LAN to laptop With LAN into a laptop via a USB-C Ethernet adapter, I saw ~500–600 Mbps - which is pretty good considering traffic is tunneling back to my home network and being encrypted. USB WAN (phone tethering) USB WAN works as expected: plug your phone into the other USB-C port and the router treats it like the WAN connection. In my test I saw ~50 Mbps to a laptop over WiFi, but that was limited by my phone’s cellular download speed at the time (confirmed by testing directly on the phone). I’m not sure where this tops out but will test with more in better service areas in the future. The “they read my mind” part: G6 Instant → UNVR over the travel router I’ve traveled with a small Wyze camera for a long time so I can check in on the dogs when we step out. I wanted to see if I could replace that with a UniFi camera and keep everything inside the UniFi ecosystem, especially the recorded footage. It worked. AG6 Instant that was already adopted to my Protect NV automatically connected to the local network, and it was able to record footage back to my UNVR through the UTR - including detections - with footage backed up remotely. That’s a big deal for me, because it means I can start packing a better “travel camera” that saves the footage to my UNVR that’s hosted in my own environment. Bonus experiment: adopting a Flex Mini over Teleport Out of curiosity, I plugged a Flex Mini 2.5G into the UTR LAN port to see what would happen. To my surprise, it detected immediately and let me adopt it - basically like I was at home. That makes it really easy to expand a remote network if you need more ports or want to plug in additional wired devices. Quick Q&amp;A: do you need a Cloud Gateway? Yes. The UTR isn’t a standalone UniFi OS console by itself. You need to bind to an existing UniFi site and using Teleport, which means you need a gateway running that site somewhere to terminate the connection. UniFi OS alone won’t work either, you need a UniFi Cloud Gateweway. Feedback / wish list At $79, this is a really good value and it checks basically all the boxes for me as a travel router. My wishlist is mostly small quality-of-life items - and I get that a lot of these would drive up cost: A little more performance headroom A tiny in-app dashboard (uplink status, traffic, client count, site) Broadcasting multiple SSIDs A padded carrying case More firewall options (power-user stuff like split tunneling / tighter control over what gets extended) Standalone mode for the UTR if you don’t want to Teleport back to your home network What I’m still testing: captive portals One thing I’m not validating in this video is captive portals. Ubiquiti says it works, but I’ll be traveling over the next few weeks and I’ll report back once I’ve tested it in the wild. Wrapping Up If you’re already running UniFi at home and you want a travel setup that feels like an extension of your network, the UTR fits that workflow really well - especially for multi-device travel and anyone who’s tired of repeatedly reconfiguring WiFi. If you’ve got questions you want me to test during travel (hotels, airports, captive portals), leave them in the comments and I’ll include them in the follow-up. Join the conversation Posted my UniFi Travel Router (UTR) workflow: - bind to my home site with Teleport- bring my SSID with me- even record a G6 Instant back to my UNVR.

You want to understand how your network behaves over time - what normal looks like, what’s changing, and how those changes correlate with real issues. This post walks through building an enterprise-style observability stack for UniFi using Unpoller, Prometheus, and Grafana, in a way that’s repeatable, approachable, and easy to run in a homelab. The goal is not just better charts, but better understanding - and hands-on experience with tooling that’s widely used in production environments. Watch the video What We’re Building At a high level, we’re collecting metrics from UniFi devices and making them available for long-term analysis and visualization. Data flow: UniFi Devices → Unpoller → Prometheus → Grafana UniFi devices expose metrics via the UniFi Network API Unpoller collects those metrics and exposes them in Prometheus format Prometheus scrapes and stores metrics over time Grafana visualizes the data using dashboards This pattern - exporter, time-series storage, visualization - is extremely common in enterprise environments, and it scales down very nicely to a homelab. Why Observability Matters Point-in-time status is useful, but it only tells you what’s happening right now. Observability gives you: Historical trends Baselines for what “normal” looks like Better troubleshooting context Capacity planning insight Instead of guessing, you can correlate behavior over hours, days, or weeks. Docker Compose Stack Everything is deployed using a single Docker Compose stack with all services preconfigured and wired together. 🔗 Complete configuration and files available on GitHub Services Included Prometheus – metrics storage Grafana – visualization Unpoller – UniFi metrics collector Dozzle (optional) – lightweight container log viewer Docker Compose File services: prometheus: image: prom/prometheus:latest restart: unless-stopped container_name: prometheus user: \"${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}\" env_file: - ./prometheus/.env ports: - '9090:9090' volumes: - ./prometheus/config:/etc/prometheus - ./prometheus/data:/prometheus grafana: image: grafana/grafana:latest restart: unless-stopped container_name: grafana user: \"${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}\" env_file: - ./grafana/.env ports: - '3000:3000' volumes: - ./grafana/data:/var/lib/grafana - ./grafana/provisioning/datasources:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources - ./grafana/provisioning/dashboards:/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards depends_on: - prometheus unpoller: image: ghcr.io/unpoller/unpoller:latest restart: unless-stopped container_name: unpoller env_file: - ./unpoller/.env ports: - '9130:9130' dozzle: image: amir20/dozzle:latest restart: unless-stopped container_name: dozzle volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock - ./dozzle/data:/data env_file: - ./dozzle/.env ports: - '8080:8080' All containers run as the same UID/GID as the host user, allowing Docker to create bind-mounted directories automatically in most homelab setups. Unpoller Configuration Unpoller is configured via environment variables. You do not need to tune every option to get started. Note: All pre-configured .env files for every service are included in the GitHub repository. You only need to update the UniFi controller details and credentials. Complete Unpoller Configuration Here’s the complete unpoller/.env file: UP_INFLUXDB_DISABLE=true UP_POLLER_DEBUG=false UP_UNIFI_DYNAMIC=false UP_PROMETHEUS_HTTP_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:9130 UP_PROMETHEUS_NAMESPACE=unpoller UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_VERIFY_SSL=false UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SAVE_ALARMS=true UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SAVE_ANOMALIES=true UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SAVE_EVENTS=true UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SAVE_IDS=true UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SAVE_SITES=true UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_VERIFY_SSL=false UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SAVE_DPI=false UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_URL=https://192.168.10.1 # change to your Unifi Controller URL UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_USER=unpoller # change to your Unifi Controller username UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_PASS=password123 # change to your Unifi Controller password UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SITE=default # this is usually 'default', change if needed TZ=America/Chicago # change to your timezone The required settings you must update are: UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_URL - Your UniFi controller address UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_USER - UniFi username UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_PASS - UniFi password UP_UNIFI_CONTROLLER_0_SITE - Usually “default” UniFi User Requirement Unpoller authenticates to UniFi using a standard UniFi account. Create a dedicated local UniFi account that has read-only access to your Network controller Read-only permissions are sufficient Use these credentials in the Unpoller .env file If authentication fails, this is the first thing to double-check. Prometheus Metrics Endpoint The Prometheus metrics endpoint is configured in the complete .env file above and exposes metrics at /metrics that Prometheus will scrape. Prometheus Scrape Configuration Prometheus needs to be told where Unpoller is running. global: scrape_interval: 15s evaluation_interval: 15s scrape_configs: - job_name: 'prometheus' static_configs: - targets: ['prometheus:9090'] - job_name: 'unpoller' static_configs: - targets: ['unpoller:9130'] scrape_interval: 30s scrape_timeout: 10s The key line is: targets: ['unpoller:9130'] This uses the Docker Compose service name, so no IP management is required. If dashboards are empty, this is one of the first places to check. Starting the Stack With everything configured, bring the stack up: docker compose up -d Access Service URL Grafana http://localhost:3000 Prometheus http://localhost:9090 Dozzle (logs) http://localhost:8080 Grafana default login: admin/admin123 (change in grafana/.env) Grafana Provisioning Grafana is fully provisioned using files on disk. Datasources are defined via provisioning Dashboards are loaded automatically on startup No manual imports required Note: All Grafana datasources and dashboards are included in the GitHub repository under the grafana/ directory. This approach is repeatable, versionable, and aligns with how Grafana is typically managed in production. Dashboards and What They Enable The stack includes pre-configured Grafana dashboards for comprehensive UniFi network monitoring: Access Points - Client counts, radio utilization, 2.4/5/6 GHz visibility Switches - Port utilization, throughput, and performance metrics Gateway - WAN performance, throughput, and edge behavior Clients - Connection history, device behavior, and usage patterns DPI - Deep packet inspection and traffic insights (requires gateway support) Sites - Multi-site overview and comparison PDU - Power distribution unit metrics (hardware-dependent) Access Points The Access Points dashboard is usually the best place to start: Client counts over time Radio utilization 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz visibility This makes it much easier to understand load distribution, interference, and capacity issues. Clients, Switches, and Gateways Additional dashboards: Client connection history and behavior Switch throughput and port utilization Gateway performance and WAN behavior The real value comes from being able to correlate changes over time rather than relying on snapshots. Bonus Dashboards Several additional dashboards are included but not required for day-one value: Gateway - throughput, latency, edge behavior PDU - power usage and device state (hardware-dependent) DPI - traffic insights (depends on gateway support and configuration) For example, the DPI dashboard will populate automatically if DPI is enabled and supported by your gateway. Not every UniFi deployment will expose every metric - that’s expected. Troubleshooting If you run into issues, here are the most common solutions: Check logs: docker compose logs [service-name] or use Dozzle at http://localhost:8080 Verify UniFi controller accessibility from Docker network Ensure a local UniFi account has been created with read-only/view-only network controller access For 429 errors, increase scrape interval in prometheus/config/prometheus.yml If dashboards are empty, check the Prometheus scrape configuration Summary With this setup in place, you now have: Long-term visibility into your UniFi network Repeatable, file-based configuration Enterprise-style tooling running at homelab scale A solid foundation for alerts, customization, and deeper analysis This approach removes much of the guesswork from monitoring and gives you both better insight and valuable hands-on experience.

I’ve been chasing this idea of having one large hybrid pool with lots of spinning disks backed by fast low latency storage for specific datasets and data access patterns within the pool. My pool contains large files, small files, Docker containers &amp; images, as well as configs and databases. Rather than create separate pools with specific hardware and assigning specific workloads to those pools, I just want one pool that can do it all (pipe dream, I know). This post documents the reasoning and the final tuned configuration so you can reproduce it (and so I can remember how I did it in the future 😅). High-Level Goals Prevent L2ARC from being filled with cold, huge media files. Force all metadata and small random I/O onto my Intel Optane special VDEV. Tune app configs and databases (Postgres, Home Assistant, Plex DB, Jellyfin, Resolve) for latency and IOPS. Performance hierarchy: ARC (RAM) – fastest Special VDEV (Optane) – second fastest HDD pool – large sequential throughput L2ARC SSD – optional read cache, slower than Optane Key realization: L2ARC is not part of the storage hierarchy. If a special VDEV exists, metadata will not be cached in L2ARC. Disabling L2ARC for large datasets prevents wasted SSD writes. Storage0 Hardware Layout Data VDEVs: 5× HDD mirrors Special VDEV: 4× Intel Optane (mirrored pair) SLOG: 1× NVMe L2ARC: 1× SSD (~900GB) Because the Optane mirror has so much room and extremely high performance, L2ARC provides almost no benefit. Dataset Strategy Datasets were grouped into functional categories and tuned accordingly. 1. Media (large sequential files) Datasets: movies tv_shows music recorded_tv Settings: recordsize = 1M primarycache = metadata secondarycache = none special_small_blocks = 0 Reasoning: Large files shouldn’t pollute ARC or L2ARC. Metadata still benefits from Optane. 2. Heavy app configs / databases Datasets: plex/config postgres jellyfin prometheus resolve/library homeassistant Settings: recordsize = 8K–16K primarycache = all secondarycache = none special_small_blocks = 64K (pool default, pushes small blocks to Optane) Reasoning: Small random I/O workloads (DBs, configs) benefit heavily from ARC + Optane. 3. Light app configs Datasets: homepage code-server scrypted dozzle Settings: secondarycache = none Reasoning: Prevents L2ARC from filling with tiny config files. 4. Datasets that benefit from L2ARC With an Optane special VDEV: None.

It’s still a tech preview, but it’s a promising step toward more flexible application hosting inside Proxmox. Watch the video Why OCI Support Matters Until now, Proxmox has traditionally focused on virtual machines and LXC containers. Both are powerful, but many applications today are distributed as OCI images on registries like Docker Hub. Adding OCI support means: You can pull widely used container images directly into Proxmox You can use familiar image tags like grafana/grafana You gain a more standardized way of handling app deployments You can use container images with full immutability This brings Proxmox closer to the workflows many homelabbers and developers already use. How Proxmox Implements OCI Containers The biggest surprise to me was that Proxmox translates OCI containers inside an LXC container (the best I can tell). This means: The OCI image is pulled and stored locally as a template Proxmox builds an LXC around it Networking and resource allocation behave like any LXC It’s different from Docker or containerd, but it keeps things portable and backup‑friendly. It also protects the host by not running containers directly on the Proxmox node. Pulling OCI Images OCI images are pulled from registries the same way you pull LXC templates. Inside your storage area for container templates, you’ll see a new option: Pull From OCI Registry You can enter something like: grafana/grafana Proxmox will: Query available tags Download the selected tagged image Store it as a .tar container template Once downloaded, the image appears in your template list just like any LXC base image. Creating a Container From an OCI Image Creating a container is similar to creating an LXC: Select Create CT Fill out the usual container details Choose your OCI image as the template Assign CPU, RAM, storage, and networking Networking uses LXC networking, not Docker networking. This gives you: Access to Proxmox bridge interfaces DHCP or static assignment No need for macvlan workarounds Clear separation from the Proxmox host itself The result is kind of a hybrid - an LXC wrapper running an OCI application inside. Running the Example: Grafana In the video I pulled the image: grafana/grafana After creating the container and letting DHCP assign an address, Grafana launched immediately inside the LXC wrapper. Visiting the LXC container’s IP brought up Grafana just like normal. It’s fast, just like containers an LXCs. Environment Variables and Configuration Proxmox exposes container configuration through a new Environment section inside the LXC Options tab. You can: View default environment variables shipped with the OCI image Add or override variables Restart the container to apply changes This is similar to Docker Compose environment variables, but exposed in the Proxmox UI. Limitations and Quirks (Keep in mind it is a Tech Preview) This feature is labeled a tech preview, and it shows. A few early limitations: Updating images is not streamlined nor even documented at this point You may need to rebuild containers instead of pulling updates (certainly hope not in the future) Console access behaves differently from a normal LXC (which is fine, but we have terminal access with LCX and even with OCI containers, so why not here?) Traditional Docker workflows (run, exec, logs) don’t exist. For all intensive purposes, one should forget the term Docker altogether. None of this was unexpected, but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re planning to test it in your homelab. What I’d Love to See Next This is a great step forward, and I’m excited about where it could go. A few things that would really make the experience better: Pulling OCI images on‑demand directly from the create menu Switching image versions without rebuilding the whole container A more streamlined update flow Optional direct host‑level container execution Console access, just as we would with containers Immutability, just like with OCI containers Update detection mechanism when new container images are released. Proxmox ha some of the foundation, now it’s about smoothing out the workflow and the limitations. Why Run OCI Images at All? Some may ask why even both with OCI images when you can install applications directly inside an LXC or VM. Here’s why I think containers are the way to go: Applications ship with all dependencies included Versions are pinned and reproducible Containerized apps behave the same across environments No need to manage system‑level package installs Faster deployment and rollback Immutable nature of containers To wrap it up, containers simplify your stack, reduce drift, and make deployments repeatable. Final Thoughts OCI support in Proxmox 9.1 may not replace Docker, but it’s a welcome addition for anyone running a homelab or managing self‑hosted services. It’s early, but it’s promising, and it’s great to see containers becoming a first‑class citizen in the Proxmox ecosystem. If I had my choice, I would still have OCI containers be a first class citizen on the platform. Personally it feels like they are doing whatever they can to avoid it. If this feature matures however, I will gladly replace my existing LXCs for an OCI based one and still hope the Proxmox team adds a truly native OCI container support. Thanks for reading, I’m Tim.— Join the conversation Proxmox 9.1 adds support for OCI containers.That means you can now run Docker-style workloads inside Proxmox using LXC.I tested it, showed how it works, and covered the current limitations.https://t.co/ieY0JDxHmm&mdash; Techno Tim (@TechnoTimLive) November 20, 2025 🛍️ Check out my recommended gear 🤝 Support the channel and help keep this site ad‑free" }, { "title": "My Private Mini Kubernetes Cluster - Secured by Tailscale", "url": "/posts/tailscale-kubernetes-operator/", "categories": "homelab, kubernetes", "tags": "kubernetes, tailscale, homelab, flux, gitops, rke2, unifi, beelink", "date": "2025-11-07 07:00:00 -0600", "content": "A compact Kubernetes cluster, completely private and connected over 5G - powered by Tailscale. 📺 Watch the video Why Build a Private Kubernetes Cluster? I wanted a way to run a full Kubernetes cluster that I could access securely from anywhere - no open ports, no complicated VPN setup, no public exposure. Tailscale made that possible by creating a secure network for exposing and connecting Kubernetes services with the Tailscale Operator. This project combines three Beelink Mini PCs, a UniFi Cloud Gateway Ultra, and a custom Dark Mode mini rack to host an RKE2-based Kubernetes cluster that’s lightweight, low-power, and entirely private. The Hardware Stack This cluster runs inside a Rackmate T0 4U mini rack, finished in black for that “Dark Mode” aesthetic. Top to bottom: UniFi Cloud Gateway Ultra - Handles routing, VLANs, and firewall rules Three Beelink Mini S PCs - Intel N150, 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD, Gigabit NIC 3D-printed mounts and magnetic blackout panels - custom printed for the rack Slim network cables - keeps everything tidy 5G WAN connection - a bit of latency, but proves how resilient this setup can be The entire rack will be given away, courtesy of Tailscale. Product Links (Affiliate) Rackmate T0 4U Mini Rack UniFi Cloud Gateways Beelink Mini S13 Pro Slim Ethernet Cables Acrylic Panels Network Configuration After assembling the rack, I powered everything up and adopted the devices in UniFi. Then I spun up a new VLAN, created a DMZ for the cluster, added zone-based firewall rules, and enabled intrusion prevention. The WAN runs entirely over 5G, which adds a bit of latency and CG-NAT fun - but it works, and that’s what makes this project interesting. Installing Ubuntu and Preparing the Nodes Next, I installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on all three Beelink Mini PCs using a Ventoy drive. Pretty standard install - repeated across all nodes. Later, I realized my PiKVM would’ve made BIOS updates and installs easier, so I connected it, installed Tailscale opn the PiKVM and enabled subnet routing flashed firmware on each device, and made sure everything was up to date. Then I reserved static IPs for each node - something you definitely want to do before joining them into a Kubernetes cluster. Deploying RKE2 For this build, I used RKE2, Rancher’s hardened Kubernetes distribution that’s FIPS 140-2 compliant and fully compatible with upstream Kubernetes. It’s really easy to get started I bootstrapped RKE2 on the first node, retrieved the cluster token, and joined the other two nodes using that token. A few moments later, I had a fully functional three-node Kubernetes cluster with distributed etcd and kubectl access. Managing Cluster State with Flux Before diving into networking, I installed Flux - a GitOps tool that manages Kubernetes state through YAML stored in Git. I already use Flux in my other clusters, so it made sense to keep this one consistent. Once bootstrapped, Flux handled deployments automatically based on my commits. Installing the Tailscale Kubernetes Operator The magic happens here. The Tailscale Kubernetes Operator brings Tailscale’s secure networking directly into your cluster - giving you private access to services, pods, and even the control plane without exposing anything publicly. I’ll briefly list my steps but I encourage to check out their documentation Setup steps: Add new tags and permissions in the Tailscale admin console Generate an OAuth client with limited write access Install the operator using Helm or Flux Verify connectivity in the Tailscale admin console Here is my flux helm release from the video: --- apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2 kind: HelmRelease metadata: name: tailscale-operator namespace: tailscale spec: interval: 30m chart: spec: chart: tailscale-operator version: 1.90.5 interval: 30m sourceRef: kind: HelmRepository name: tailscale-charts namespace: flux-system values: operatorConfig: hostname: \"tailscale-operator-mini-cluster\" apiServerProxyConfig: mode: \"true\" If you’re using helm, you can install it using these commands: Add the Tailscale Helm repository: helm repo add tailscale https://pkgs.tailscale.com/helmcharts Update the Helm repositories: helm repo update Install the Tailscale operator, don’t forget to use your OAuth client and Secret from the Tailscale Admin Console. helm upgrade \\ --install \\ tailscale-operator \\ tailscale/tailscale-operator \\ --namespace=tailscale \\ --create-namespace \\ --set-string oauth.clientId=\"&lt;OAuth client ID&gt;\" \\ --set-string oauth.clientSecret=\"&lt;OAuth client secret&gt;\" \\ --set-string apiServerProxyConfig.mode=\"true\" \\ --wait Once installed, the cluster appeared as a new machine on my Tailnet. Secure Access to the Kubernetes API I enabled API proxy mode in Helm, allowing me to access the Kubernetes API securely through Tailscale. After updating grants in the Tailscale admin console to impersonate Kubernetes admin privileges, I could connect remotely from anywhere using my Tailscale-authenticated kube config. This should have already been enabled from the helm command argument of --set-string apiServerProxyConfig.mode=\"true\". If you didn’t use this flag, just run the command again with the flag but use upgrade instead helm upgrade. You will need to decide on permissions, I suggest reviewing the impersonation section in the docs Once everything is in place, you just need to run a command to configure your kube config with a new context. tailscale configure kube config tailscale-operator It will output the new context, switch to it kube config use-context tailscale-operator-mini-cluster.tail1234.ts.net # replace with your operator FQDN Then run a command to test it kube config get nodes and you should see something like: NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION k8s-home-1 Ready control-plane,etcd,master 102d v1.33.5+rke2r1 k8s-home-2 Ready control-plane,etcd,master 102d v1.33.5+rke2r1 k8s-home-3 Ready control-plane,etcd,master 102d v1.33.5+rke2r1 k8s-home-worker-1 Ready worker 102d v1.33.5+rke2r1 k8s-home-worker-2 Ready worker 102d v1.33.5+rke2r1 k8s-home-worker-3 Ready worker 102d v1.33.5+rke2r1 No exposed ports, no manual VPN configuration - just private access through the Tailnet. Hosting Private Services (Draw.io) To test it out, I deployed Draw.io inside the cluster. Instead of exposing it publicly or relying on kubectl port-forward, I created a Tailscale ingress that made the service securely available on my Tailnet with a trusted certificate. Here is a minimal deployment file for DawIO deployment.yaml --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: drawio namespace: default spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: drawio template: metadata: labels: app: drawio spec: containers: - name: drawio image: jgraph/drawio:latest ports: - containerPort: 8080 then apply the deployment with: kubectl apply ./deployment.yaml Then you’ll want to create a Tailscale Ingress ingress.yaml --- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: diagram-tailscale-ingress namespace: default spec: defaultBackend: service: name: diagram port: number: 8080 ingressClassName: tailscale tls: - hosts: - diagram --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: diagram namespace: default spec: type: ClusterIP selector: app: diagram ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 Then apply it kubectl apply -f ./ingress.yaml This will expose this service on your Tailnet. You will see it in your Tailscale Admin Console and you will be able to access it securely, with certificates, using the FQDN. e.g. https://diagram.tail1234.ts.net Now I can access Draw.io privately from any device connected to Tailscale. Cross-Cluster Monitoring I didn’t want to run a separate monitoring stack, so I used Tailscale’s cluster-to-cluster communication to let my homelab’s Grafana and Prometheus scrape metrics from this new mini cluster. With a Tailscale Load Balancer in front of Node Exporter, and an egress service pointing back from my home cluster, Prometheus was able to pull metrics over the Tailnet securely. The key here is to expose the service on one side, and then create an egress on the other side. The ingress should be created like the drawIO example above, exposing the service to your Tailnet, and then creating an egress that points to the IP on your Tailnet (as seen on the Tailscale Admin Dashboard) Node Exporter Service side (mini-server) service.yaml --- # LoadBalancer for node 1 - using nodeSelector + pod network apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: node-exporter-1 namespace: default annotations: tailscale.com/expose: \"true\" spec: type: LoadBalancer loadBalancerClass: tailscale ports: - port: 9100 targetPort: 9100 protocol: TCP name: metrics # Instead of selector, we'll create individual endpoints --- # Endpoints for node 1 apiVersion: v1 kind: Endpoints metadata: name: node-exporter-1 namespace: default subsets: - addresses: - ip: 192.168.200.101 # mini-server-1 IP ports: - port: 9100 name: metrics Prometheus Service side (Prometheus scraper) service.yaml --- # Egress service for mini-server-1 apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: mini-cluster-node-1 namespace: default annotations: tailscale.com/tailnet-ip: \"100.124.122.6\" spec: type: ExternalName externalName: placeholder ports: - name: metrics port: 9100 targetPort: 9100 protocol: TCP --- Moments later, Grafana displayed the new “Mini Cluster” node - fully integrated and private. The Mini Rack Giveaway This entire Dark Mode rack - running RKE2, Flux, and the Tailscale Kubernetes Operator - is being given away, thanks to Tailscale. To find out how to enter, check out the details in the Tailscale Discord community. Final Thoughts Over the past few weeks, I’ve gone from knowing very little about Tailscale beyond its mesh networking to using it for multi-cluster connectivity and zero-trust access. It’s completely changed how I think about Kubernetes networking - making something complex feel almost easy 😅 . I’m Tim - thanks for reading and for watching.

Docker Model Runner is a standardized way to run AI models with Docker. Instead of juggling Python versions, CUDA, and random system packages, you pull and run a model much like you’d pull and run an image. You can use it from the CLI, in Docker Desktop, and inside your Compose files. Highlights: One command to run models (pulls on-demand) OpenAI-compatible endpoints exposed locally Works with Docker Compose alongside your app/database/cache Local-first: low latency, easy iteration, real dev/prod parity Prerequisites Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows) or Docker CE (Linux) (Optional) GPU drivers/toolkit if you plan to use GPU acceleration If you’re on Docker Desktop and don’t see the model commands, update to the latest version and enable Docker Model in Settings. Getting Started (CLI) Pull models just like images - but use the new model keyword. # Pull OpenAI’s open-weight model hosted by Docker docker model pull ai/gpt-oss # Pull something smaller docker model pull ai/llama3.2 # See what’s local docker model list You can also run without pre-pulling: docker model run ai/gpt-oss This will pull the model if needed and start an interactive CLI where you can chat immediately. First response may take a moment while the model warms up. Not a CLI person? The Models section in Docker Desktop lets you pull, run, and chat with models via the UI in just a couple clicks. Using Docker Model Runner with Compose Anywhere you can run Docker Compose, you can run models too. Here’s a real example pairing Open WebUI with Docker Model Runner: services: open-webui: image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main ports: - \"3000:8080\" environment: - OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/v1 - OPENAI_API_KEY='' - WEBUI_NAME=Open-WebUI with Docker Model Runner volumes: - open-webui:/app/backend/data depends_on: - docker-model-runner docker-model-runner: provider: type: model options: model: ai/gpt-oss volumes: open-webui: Bring it up: docker compose up Open WebUI will be on http://localhost:3000, and it will talk to the model via the OpenAI-compatible URL set in OPENAI_API_BASE_URL. Swapping models later is just a one-line change to options.model. Develop Locally with techno-boto-chat I built a small Next.js chat app that speaks to any OpenAI-compatible backend - including Docker Model Runner - so you can prototype quickly with local models. Check out techno-boto-chat on GitHub # Clone and set up git clone https://github.com/timothystewart6/techno-boto-chat.git cd techno-boto-chat yarn install # or npm / pnpm # Configure environment cp .env.example .env.local Set your API base + model in .env.local: LLM_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:12434/engines/v1 MODEL_NAME=ai/gpt-oss OPENAI_API_KEY= # optional for local models Run app + model: # Terminal A - start a local model or use Docker Desktop to start docker model run ai/gpt-oss # Terminal B - run the web app yarn dev # then open http://localhost:3000 Type a prompt and you’ll see responses come back from your local model via Docker Model Runner. Want to try a different model? Change MODEL_NAME and restart. Prefer everything in containers? Add the app as a Compose service and point it to model-runner.docker.internal just like the Open WebUI example. Running with Docker Compose The application is containerized for easy deployment: # Build and deploy with Docker Compose docker compose up --build -d # Access your chat interface at http://localhost:3000 # Don't forget to switch your LLM_API_BASE_URL variable to http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/v1 if you aren't exposing it on localhost:12434 Docker Desktop vs Docker CE Endpoints Docker Desktop: http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/v1 Docker CE (Linux): http://localhost:12434/engines/v1 Inside other containers, you may need to call the host at its bridge IP (e.g., 172.17.0.1:12434) if not using the Desktop hostname. Troubleshooting Model commands missing → update Docker Desktop and enable Docker Model in Settings Slow first response → initial warm-up/load is expected; subsequent prompts are faster App can’t reach model → verify OPENAI_API_BASE_URL (Desktop vs CE), port exposure, and network Compose service ordering → ensure your app depends_on the model service Can’t connect to localhost:12434 → ensure Enable host-side TCP support is enabled in Docker Desktop and you are not running inside of a container (that uses http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/v1) Join the conversation What is Docker Model Runner - and why should you care?

Beelink ME Mini PC NAS", "url": "/posts/proxmox-lxc-me-mini/", "categories": "proxmox", "tags": "homelab, proxmox, self-hosted, lxc", "date": "2025-08-09 08:00:00 -0500", "content": "Everyone thinks this is a NAS. I don’t. It’s a low power Proxmox LXC Server and it’s awesome! 📺 Watch Video Intro The Beelink ME Mini has been generating attention as a small form factor NAS, and with its compact footprint and six NVMe slots, it’s easy to see why. But after spending time with it, I think it has another role worth exploring: virtualization. While it’s marketed for storage, pairing it with Proxmox and LXC containers turns it into a surprisingly capable low-power app engine. The CPU specs may not impress on paper, but it handles more than you might think. I decided to test it that way, loading it with containers, a few VMs, and monitoring its performance. Unboxing &amp; First Impressions The ME Mini has a smaller than the Beelink EQ14, and has an internal power supply instead of an external brick. Ports: Front: USB-C, USB-A 3.0 Rear: HDMI, USB-A 2.0, dual 2.5 GbE LAN Inside, you’ll find: Intel N150 Twin Lake 4 Cores 4 Threads Turbos up to 3.6 GHz Six labeled NVMe slots Internal power supply Wireless &amp; Bluetooth radios A large, All-in-one heatsink with thermal pads for all NVMe drives Opening it requires removing some weird screw protectors. These are totally unnecessary and they should get rid of these. Once inside, the cooling solution in pretty impressive. It cools the CPU, all 6 NVMe drives, and the WiFi and Bluetooth chips. Storage Layout The included Crucial NVMe in Slot 1 (PCIe 3.0 x2) became my OS drive. The other five slots run at PCIe 3.0 x1, so while you can fill all six, bandwidth will be limited under heavy load. Given the x1 lanes, using the cheapest NVMe drives you can find makes more sense than loading it with high-end models. Power Consumption &amp; Setup With one NVMe installed, idle power draw hovered around 15–20W running Windows. After initially setting it up, I skipped Windows entirely and installed Proxmox VE. BIOS tweaks: Enabled VT-D Disabled Hibernate &amp; Sleep “Restore AC Power” is actually listed under Chipset &gt; PCH-IO Configuration &gt; State After G3 &gt; S0 State. This will restore power to the device after power loss (something I didn’t realize when evaluating this machine) Installing Proxmox was straightforward, aside from a long pause at “Creating LVSs (normal on some mini-PCs like Beelink and Minisforums machines, just wait it out). LXC Containers on the ME Mini Once Proxmox was installed, I ran my Proxmox Helper Scripts to: Disable enterprise repos Enable no-subscription repo Disable HA &amp; Corosync Update system I created a ZFS pool on four Samsung 990 Pros in a stripe (no redundancy). Performance hit ~15K IOPS - on par with my Mac Studio M2 in a similar test. Then I deployed a bunch of container, similar to the Docker containers I am running on my NAS: PiHole Authelia Minio Mongodb MySQL Postgres Redis Uptime Kuma Homepage Immich Plex Tautulli Home Assistant Core n8n Zigbee2mqtt Mqtt Traefik Grafana Jellyfin Ubuntu VM Resource usage with all running: RAM: ~50% of 12GB CPU: 2–8% average Power: ~14–15W LXC containers made the difference - minimal overhead, instant startup, less resources, and higher density than VMs. Bonus VM Tests Ubuntu Server VM: Runs fine, but LXCs are more efficient here so unless you need full isolation, just run the LXC version of Ubuntu. Windows 11 VM: Works, but sluggish - I would only do this if absolutely necessary and for light, occasional use. GPU Transcoding for Plex &amp; Jellyfin Note: Proxmox recently release 9.0, which includes Linux kernel 9.14 Out of the box, Plex couldn’t detect the integrated Twin Lake GPU - the default Proxmox kernel was too old. I updated to kernel 6.15 using the Zabbly project, which temporarily broke ZFS until I upgraded it as well. Once I fixed that, both Plex and Jellyfin successfully used the GPU for hardware transcoding. Note: Kernel upgrades on Proxmox carry risk - only do this if you need Twin Lake GPU support. Final Thoughts The Beelink ME Mini works as a NAS, but shines as a low-power Proxmox LXC host. Highlights: Runs many services with low CPU/RAM usage Integrated GPU for media transcoding Compact and efficient - ideal for app hosting, dashboards, and self-hosted tools If you don’t need six NVMe slots, the EQ14 might be a cheaper option. But for compact, quiet, and flexible virtualization, the ME Mini delivers far more uses cases than their NAS focused marketing suggests.

Bonus: Run Home Assistant with macvlan and Traefik on TrueNAS If you’re self-hosting Home Assistant on TrueNAS, and you want: Native device discovery on your LAN (or VLAN!) Reverse proxy access through your domain A clean, Compose-managed setup Then this combo of Docker Compose + macvlan + Traefik is exactly what you’re looking for. Note: This setup is designed for users with a single NIC. I have it connected to a bond in my homelab, which works fine, but I just want to keep it simple for this example. Also, you can host your Home Assistant on one network or VLAN while having your TrueNAS on another (that’s how I do it). Why macvlan? By using macvlan, you give your Home Assistant container a LAN IP, just like a physical device. This enables: Proper device discovery (e.g., Google Home, Shelly, Zigbee) Direct network communication with other LAN devices Better compatibility with smart home protocols What You Need Assumptions for this setup: Your NIC is eth0 Your LAN subnet is 192.168.20.0/24 Your gateway is 192.168.20.1 You want Home Assistant to have IP 192.168.20.202 You’re using Traefik as a reverse proxy (but optional) docker-compose.yml services: homeassistant: container_name: homeassistant image: ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable pull_policy: always restart: unless-stopped env_file: - .env security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true networks: iot_macvlan: ipv4_address: 192.168.20.202 traefik: volumes: - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro - /mnt/storage0/home-assistant/config:/config labels: - \"traefik.enable=true\" - \"traefik.http.routers.homeassistant.rule=Host(`homeassistant.yourdomain.com`)\" - \"traefik.http.routers.homeassistant.entrypoints=https\" - \"traefik.http.routers.homeassistant.tls=true\" - \"traefik.http.routers.homeassistant.tls.certresolver=cloudflare\" - \"traefik.http.services.homeassistant.loadbalancer.server.port=8123\" networks: iot_macvlan: external: true traefik: external: true Note: The iot_macvlan and traefik networks must already exist as external Docker networks. You can create the macvlan network using the command below. Create the macvlan Network You only need to create the macvlan network once: docker network create -d macvlan \\ --subnet=192.168.20.0/24 \\ --gateway=192.168.20.1 \\ -o parent=eth0 \\ iot_macvlan Warning: macvlan works best with physical interfaces like eth0. It can work with bonded or VLAN interfaces too, but compatibility depends on your network setup and driver support. (I am using a bond without ay issues but worth mentioning in case you run into issues) Danger: If you assign the same IP to more than one container or device, it will cause an IP conflict and could take your Home Assistant or host offline. macvlan + Traefik Setting Value Description Interface eth0 Your physical NIC or bond that has access to tagged packets Subnet 192.168.20.0/24 Matches your LAN range Gateway 192.168.20.1 Gateway IP Home Assistant IP 192.168.20.202 LAN IP assigned to the container Domain homeassistant.yourdomain.com Used in your Traefik rule Networks iot_macvlan, traefik Must exist as external networks, created with the docker command Results With this setup: Home Assistant has a dedicated IP on your LAN You can access it securely via Traefik + HTTPS Everything is defined in Compose. Bonus: Fix Custom Icons for TrueNAS Custom Apps By default, when you deploy a custom app on TrueNAS using your own Docker Compose, the app will likely show up with a missing or blank icon in the Apps UI. Fortunately, you can fix that by editing the app’s metadata file. Update the App Metadata Edit the following file on your TrueNAS system: /mnt/.ix-apps/app_configs/YOUR_APP_NAME/metadata.yaml Add the icon: property inside the metadata: block. For example: custom_app: true human_version: 1.0.0_custom metadata: app_version: custom capabilities: [] description: This is a custom app where user can use his/her own docker compose file for deploying services home: '' host_mounts: [] maintainers: [] name: custom-app run_as_context: [] sources: [] title: Custom App train: stable version: 1.0.0 icon: https://media.sys.truenas.net/apps/homepage/icons/icon.png migrated: false notes: null portals: {} version: 1.0.0 Note: You will need to redeploy the app and refresh the UI for the icon to show up. Mount App Configs in Code Server If you’re using Code Server like I am, you can easily edit app configs like this by mounting the app config directory into your container: volumes: - /mnt/.ix-apps/app_configs/:/ix-apps This makes /ix-apps accessible from inside Code Server, so you can quickly edit metadata, YAML, or other settings. Bonus: Embed Icons with Base64 (No Internet Needed) If you’re customizing app metadata on TrueNAS SCALE, you can embed an image directly using a Base64-encoded Data URL. This is perfect if you don’t want your system to rely on the internet just to load icons. This method was originally shared in this excellent TrueNAS forum thread: How to change icon of custom app Option 1: Encode via Command Line (JPEG Example) Linux: base64 -w 0 your-image.jpg &gt; output.txt macOS: base64 your-image.jpg &gt; output.txt Then embed it into your app’s metadata like this: icon: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD...' Replace ... with the full Base64 string from output.txt Option 2: Use a Web Tool Use base64.guru/converter/encode/image Upload your image (JPEG/PNG/etc.) Choose “Data URI” as the output format Copy the full result into your app’s metadata: icon: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD...' Why This Is Useful Keeps apps fully offline-capable Avoids pulling icons from GitHub, Docker Hub, or external URLs Ideal for self-contained deployments on isolated or air-gapped TrueNAS SCALE systems Join the conversation &quot;Keep your data close… but your apps closer.&quot;My new setup runs Docker apps on TrueNAS the clean way — using Compose, .env, and no hacks.https://t.co/RQ90braua3 pic.twitter.com/NNvDO0zn0O&mdash; Techno Tim (@TechnoTimLive) July 15, 2025 Links 🛍️ Check out the new Merch Shop at https://l.technotim.com/shop ⚙️ See all the hardware I recommend at https://l.technotim.com/gear 🚀 Don’t forget to check out the 🚀Launchpad repo with all of the quick start source files 🤝 Support me and help keep this site ad-free!" }, { "title": "Self-Host Your Own Automation Platform with n8n + Docker", "url": "/posts/n8n-self-hosted/", "categories": "self-hosted", "tags": "homelab, n8n, self-hosted, workflow, automation", "date": "2025-07-11 08:00:00 -0500", "content": "n8n is a powerful self-hosted workflow automation tool. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to self-host n8n on Linux using Docker. You’ll learn how to set up the environment, configure it with a .env file, and build workflows that connect to services like Google Sheets and Discord. We’ll start with a simple manual trigger, then create a scheduled workflow, and move on to a more advanced automation that pulls in data from external services and processes it through n8n’s visual workflow editor. Whether you’re just exploring n8n or ready to start building, this guide will help you get up and running with a flexible, powerful automation platform. 📺 Watch Video Info For this setup, I’ll be using Docker Compose on Ubuntu Linux—specifically the latest Ubuntu LTS and the latest version of Docker with Compose support. This makes the setup clean, consistent, and easy to repeat. To to learn more about n8n, check out the GitHub repo Install Docker To install docker, see this post Setting Up Let’s walk through the initial setup. Check Docker Installation First, make sure Docker is installed and working by running: docker -v If that returns a version, you’re good to go. Create the Project Folder I like to keep things organized under /opt/stacks, but you can adjust this to fit your structure: sudo mkdir -p /opt/stacks/n8n sudo chown serveradmin:serveradmin -R /opt/stacks cd /opt/stacks/n8n Create the Docker Compose File Create the file: nano compose.yaml Paste in the following yaml: services: n8n: image: n8nio/n8n:latest restart: always ports: - \"5678:5678\" env_file: - .env volumes: - ./data:/home/node/.n8n - ./files:/files depends_on: - postgres # labels: # - \"traefik.enable=true\" # - \"traefik.http.routers.${TRAEFIK_ROUTER_NAME}.rule=Host(`${TRAEFIK_DOMAIN}`)\" # - \"traefik.http.routers.${TRAEFIK_ROUTER_NAME}.entrypoints=websecure\" # - \"traefik.http.routers.${TRAEFIK_ROUTER_NAME}.tls.certresolver=${TRAEFIK_CERT_RESOLVER}\" # - \"traefik.http.services.${TRAEFIK_ROUTER_NAME}.loadbalancer.server.port=5678\" # If you're running your own external PostgreSQL instance, you can comment out this service postgres: image: postgres:15 restart: always env_file: - .env volumes: - ./postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data This gives us a working setup using Docker Compose, with support for environment variables, volumes for persistence, and optional Traefik labels if you want to enable TLS down the line. Create the .env File Create and edit the environment file: nano .env Paste in your values: # n8n Settings DOMAIN_NAME=example.com SUBDOMAIN=n8n GENERIC_TIMEZONE=America/New_York N8N_HOST=n8n.example.com N8N_PROTOCOL=https WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/ N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=false NODE_ENV=production # Traefik (optional) TRAEFIK_ROUTER_NAME=n8n TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=n8n.example.com TRAEFIK_CERT_RESOLVER=mytlschallenge # PostgreSQL POSTGRES_DB=n8n POSTGRES_USER=n8n POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme123 This file lets us easily manage settings, especially if you’re running multiple stacks. If you’re using Traefik, the optional labels in compose.yaml will pull values from here automatically. Starting the Stack Navigate to your project directory: cd /opt/stacks/n8n Then bring everything up in the background: docker compose up -d Docker will pull the required images and spin up your containers. Once that’s done, n8n should be up and running—by default on port 5678, or at the domain you configured if you’re using a reverse proxy like Traefik. Confirm It’s Running To confirm everything started correctly, run: docker ps You should see both the n8n and postgres containers listed and running. If not, check the logs with: docker compose logs This can help troubleshoot any startup issues. Exploring n8n With everything up and running, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5678 or use your domain if you’ve set up a reverse proxy. You’ll be prompted to create an admin account the first time you log in. From here, you’re ready to start building workflows.

In this video, I walk through what it is, why it matters, and how to set it up in TrueNAS and some from the terminal. I’ll also share real-world benchmarks comparing pools with and without a special VDEV, so you can see the difference for yourself. 📺 Watch Video Testing I created a test script that you can find here: https://github.com/timothystewart6/zfs-tools The test script will try to create a pool based on 3 drives. HDD1, HDD2, and NVME_SPECIAL. You can modify these to match your disk Ids. You can find your disk Ids by running: ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/ You can also adjust the test files by changing TEST_COUNT however I found that 100,000 is a good number to get consistent results. Update the script with your disk Ids. You can then run the script: chmod +x zfs-metadata.sh # make it executable ./zfs-metadata.sh # run the script It will create 2 pools, test-1 and test-2, test-2 has the special vdeb. This will take a long time to run depending on your system, disks, and TEST_COUNT. When it’s done, you will find the results in /mnt/test-results/ If you want to check the small blocks values for your pool: List pool zpool list -v test-1 # change based on your pool name Setting Small Blocks &amp; Record Size To change your small blocks value you can do so like this, however it’s a good idea to check your record size first zfs get recordsize test-1 You should see something like: NAME PROPERTY VALUE SOURCE test-1 recordsize 128K default You always want to be sure that your record size &gt; small blocks size, otherwise all blocks will be written Get value zfs get special_small_blocks test-1 -r # change based on your pool name Set value zfs set special_small_blocks=64k test-1 # change based on your pool name and the small block value you want to use If you want to use something higher than 128K you would do something like this zfs set recordsize=256K test-1/yourdataset zfs set special_small_blocks=128K test-1/yourdataset My Test results Random Read (4K, iodepth=1) Here are my results from the video. test-1 pool was a single 14TB EXOS drive test-2 pool was a single 14TB EXOS drive + a Samsung 990 Pro NVMe Metric test-1 (HDD only) test-2 (Special VDEV) Improvement IOPS 4,331 57,200 +1,220% Bandwidth 16.9 MiB/s 223 MiB/s +1,220% Avg Latency 865.88 µs 66.35 µs −92% 99% Latency 8.0 µs 2.8 µs −65% Read IO Completed 2.0 GiB 26.2 GiB +1,210% Random Write (4K, iodepth=1) Metric test-1 (HDD only) test-2 (Special VDEV) Change IOPS 209 195 −6.7% Bandwidth 838 KiB/s 782 KiB/s −6.7% Avg Latency 18.8 ms 20.2 ms +7.4% (worse) 99% Latency 10.18 µs 10.82 µs Slightly worse Random Write (4K, iodepth=16) Metric test-1 (HDD only) test-2 (Special VDEV) Improvement IOPS 210 229 +9% Bandwidth 840 KiB/s 919 KiB/s +9% Avg Latency 303.8 ms 277.4 ms −8.7% 99% Latency 701 ms 376 ms −46.4% 99.95% Latency 776 ms 443 ms −43% Max Latency 842 ms 516 ms −38.7% Random Read/Write (4K, iodepth=16) Metric test-1 (HDD only) test-2 (Special VDEV) Improvement Read IOPS 196 247 +26% Write IOPS 196 246 +25% Read Bandwidth 788 KiB/s 989 KiB/s +25.5% Write Bandwidth 786 KiB/s 986 KiB/s +25.5% Avg Read Latency 160.15 ms 127.45 ms −20% Avg Write Latency 163.93 ms 130.24 ms −20.5% 99% Read Latency 502 ms 207 ms −58.8% 99% Write Latency 506 ms 209 ms −58.7% Metadata – Random Access (20,000 files) Pool Duration (s) Improvement test-1 71.91 s — test-2 65.73 s +8.6% faster Metadata – Sequential Access (20,000 files) Pool Duration (s) Improvement test-1 139.80 s — test-2 81.62 s +41.6% faster 📦 Products in this video 📦 While enterprise gear is great for businesses, I have found that if you have a good warranty, redundancy, and understand the trade-offs, consumer gear works great for home.

What I didn’t expect was how tricky it would be to swap out the PSU — specifically replacing the stock Corsair one with the Seasonic TX-1600 Noctua Edition. Spoiler: the PSU swap itself was the easy part. The Power Breakout Board The HL15 includes a breakout board that distributes power to the fans and the backplane using four 4-pin Molex connectors, but here’s the catch - the 6-pin-to-Molex power cables that 45Drives includes are custom-made for Corsair PSUs. They don’t work with Seasonic’s modular pin-out or any other brand for that matter. This is common practice among all power supply makers and something I didn’t even think about when starting this swap. HL15 power breakout board Since I had already replaced all the fans and wired them directly to my SuperMicro motherboard (which gave me full PWM control), I figured I could skip the breakout board and wire the backplane directly. The Molex Nightmare Seasonic only includes one 6-pin to 4-pin Molex cable, and I needed four. Worse, the backplane is powered entirely via Molex, the same old 4-pin IDE-style connectors that IDE drive used (which no one has by the way). I wonder why they have not switched SATA power. It’s more available, and the cables are far more suited for the tight spacing underneath the HL15’s backplane. I’m assuming it’s just a design that dates back to when it was first designed for servers. Also, since they own the design for the backplane they can also design any cables they want. HL15 power breakout cables for fans and backplane The Cable Search I searched for Seasonic compatible 6-pin to Molex cables. No luck. Seasonic pointed me to BTOS Integration, who doesn’t make or sell these cables. Noctua, despite collaborating on the PSU, had no cable leads (pun intended). CableMod couldn’t offer right-angle Molex ends that would clear the space under the backplane. ModDIY could make custom right-angle Molex cables but at ~$30 each after customizing the length. I needed 8 cables (2 servers), which would run nearly $300 with shipping. Not the end of the world, but I wanted to shop around before shelling out this kind of money for cables. I then contact 45Drives directly since they made the original cables for Corsair PSUs, I hoped they’d offer ones for Seasonic too. I thought they might be interested since they have partnered with Noctua on fans and might sell this PSU at some point. Unfortunately they could not make them. They suggested I contact CableMod, which I already did, so the cable hunt continues. At this point I was running SATA-to-Molex adapters (affiliate link) as a temporary workaround, creating a rat’s nest of cables. A Needle in the Haystack After scouring eBay, Amazon, and finally AliExpress, I found a set of cables that looked promising, a 6-pin power to 3x 4-pin Molex (IDE) right-angle power cable that is supposedly compatible with Seasonic power supplies. The listing is now gone, but here’s the archived product. I ordered 9 cables ($3.56 each—one spare) and waited. “Seasonic compatible” 6-pin to Molex cables Safety First When the cables arrived, I didn’t plug them in immediately. I needed to make sure the pin-outs matched. I almost fried my PSU and backplane once by using the Corsair cables, I didn’t want to do that again. I posted this question on X: “What are the odds that these “Seasonic compatible” power cables fry my server” What are the odds that these “Seasonic compatible” power cables fry my server pic.twitter.com/XaDUCvz0dS&mdash; Techno Tim (@TechnoTimLive) April 30, 2025 Digital Spaceport chimed in with video on how to test cables using a multimeter (thank you!), and five minutes later I had verified the new cable’s pin-outs match the OEM Seasonic cables! Toning out the cables The Final Install With the pin-outs verified, I tore the HL15 apart again, removed the breakout board, ditched all the adapter cables, and installed the new ones. Each backplane Molex connector now had its own dedicated cable and power lane to the PSU. New Molex cables I hit the power button… and it worked. No sparks. No dead drives. Just clean direct power. Final Thoughts This whole adventure reaffirmed two things: Always test your modular cables. Even if they look the same, they aren’t. Power supplies should use standardized modular connectors—or none at all. This halfway point of using identical-looking connectors with proprietary pin-outs is a recipe for disaster. I feel like it’s in everyone’s best interest for power supply makers to standardize this. If you’re planning to swap PSUs in your HL15 or PC/server that has parts made for a different PSU, be ready to go deep into the rabbit hole of custom cables. And yes those old Molex connectors are still around, like it or not. The HL15 is finally back in the rack, and it’s running great. Clean cables, quiet fans, and solid power delivery. Done wiring (for now) The PSU and backplane are all cleaned up If you’re curious, I ranted about this whole issue with modular power cables and PSU manufacturers here: I Rebuilt My Home Server — Quieter, Faster, and Ready for 2025 Also, if you’re interested in this PSU it’s hard to find right now.

In this video, I’ll show you a tool called Nebula Sync that helps keep them in sync, making DNS and blocklist management much easier. I’ll walk through how it works, how to set it up, how to choose the right settings, and why it might be useful for your network. 📺 Watch Video Info Don’t forget to give these repos a star! https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole https://github.com/lovelaze/nebula-sync What you’ll need to get started 2 fully working Pi-hole servers Docker running somewhere in your environment Also, I mentioned that I would show you how to reset your Pi-hole password in the video, but never showed how 😅. Here’s how: ssh into your Pi-hole server. sudo pihole setpassword Your password will instantly be updated. Upgrading from Pi-Hole 5 + Gravity Sync Note: Pi-Hole 6 is not compatible with gravity-sync so if you’re using Pi-Hole 5 or gravity-sync please follow this first DO NOT UPGRADE TO PI-HOLE 6 YET Uninstall gravity-sync by running: gravity-sync purge This should remove gravity-sync Personally I would reboot the server afterwards and run gravity-sync command afterwards to be sure it’s fully remove. You should get an error like command not found: gravity-sync, which means it’s fully removed. Next I take a backup of your Pi-Hole instance and even export your config with Teleporter just to be sure. Upgrade to Pi-Hole 6. Test it, reboot it, make sure it works. Do this for each Pi-Hole 5 instance you have. Then continue on with this tutorial. Install Docker To install docker, see this post Instructions ssh into server. I usually put my stacks into /opt/stacks. Make a new directory for Nebula Sync and cd into it. mkdir nebula-sync cd nebula-sync Create our compose file. nano compose.yaml Inside of our compose.yaml paste: --- services: nebula-sync: image: ghcr.io/lovelaze/nebula-sync:latest container_name: nebula-sync restart: unless-stopped env_file: .env Create our .env with our variables.

Install updated postgres repositories. sudo apt update sudo apt install -y postgresql-common sudo /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh Install postgres and additional modules. sudo apt update sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib We’ll configure postgres later.

I’ll show you what worked, what didn’t, and how I ultimately built a stable, high-performance connection that meets my needs. Thank you Micro Center for sponsoring today’s video!

Please continue on to the end. Here are 2 Docker compose files that you can use on your system. My Docker Compose Stack The stack is the one I use in the video as well as at home. If you want to use the general stack without traefik and macvlan, see the general Docker compose stack Before running this, you will need to create the network for Docker to use. This might already exist if you are using traefik. If so skip this step. docker network create traefik This will create the macvlan network.

(this will create the folder for you) git clone https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker.git After cloning, you’ll want to make a change to the Docker file nano stable-diffusion-webui-docker/services/comfy/Dockerfile I commented out the pinning to commit hash and just grabbed the latest comfy.

I am using stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium You’ll want to download all of the models and then transfer them to your server and put them in the appropriate folders Models will need to bt placed in the Stable-diffusion folder. stable-diffusion-webui-docker/data/models/Stable-diffusion Models are any file in the root of stable-diffusion-3-medium that have the extension *.safetensors For clips, you’ll need to create this folder (because it doesn’t exist) mkdir stable-diffusion-webui-docker/data/models/CLIPEncoder In there you’ll place your clips, from the text_encoders folder from stable-diffusion-3-medium Example Workflows for ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium You’ll need to download the same workflows to the machine that accesses ComfyUI so you can import them into the browser. Example workflows are also available on HuggingFace in the Stable Diffusion 3 Medium repo Verifying Models If you’re going to spend all of that time downloading these model files, you should also pend a few minutes verifying them. I typically do this once they are on the server running the AI Stack shasum -a 256 ./sd3_medium.safetensors This should output something like: cc236278d28c8c3eccb8e21ee0a67ebed7dd6e9ce40aa9de914fa34e8282f191 ./sd3_medium.safetensors You’ll want to be sure the checksum matches the checksum from the source (HuggingFace, etc).

Notes This project was built using rpi-rgb-led-matrix After getting the new power supply I noticed a few odd things When powered via hat only with the new 5v/10a AC to DC power supply, the USB drive wasn’t recognized When powering via USB-C 5v/5a the LED panel was too dim to display some colors so it looked distorted I read the Pi hat documentation over and over, and no where did it mention that anything else was needed other than a large power supply. I thought for sure it was now a hardware issue and was in over my head. I dropped a message in a Discord that both Jeff Geerling and I are in and he mentioned checking out this post In that post it suggests to add max_usb_current=1 to your config.txt. I tested it and sure enough the Pi can now power the LED panel, the Pi, and the USB drive all from a single power supply connected to the hat. 🎉 Thanks Jeff!

Place the following contents inside of the config.yaml storage: type: postgres path: \"postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?sslmode=disable\" endpoints: - name: back-end group: core url: \"https://example.org/\" interval: 5m conditions: - \"[STATUS] == 200\" - \"[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] &gt; 48h\" - name: monitoring group: internal url: \"https://example.org/\" interval: 5m conditions: - \"[STATUS] == 200\" - name: nas group: internal url: \"https://example.org/\" interval: 5m conditions: - \"[STATUS] == 200\" - name: example-dns-query url: \"8.8.8.8\" # Address of the DNS server to use interval: 5m dns: query-name: \"example.com\" query-type: \"A\" conditions: - \"[BODY] == 93.184.216.34\" - \"[DNS_RCODE] == NOERROR\" - name: icmp-ping url: \"icmp://example.org\" interval: 1m conditions: - \"[CONNECTED] == true\" Be sure to update the DB hostname with your IP if you’re using an external database. path: \"postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@192.168.30.240:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?sslmode=disable\" You can use DNS here too if you like e.g. @database.example.com:5432 Starting Gatus Now we can start our container gatus docker compose up -d Check to be sure the container is running with out errors docker logs gatus-gatus-1 Before we check out the UI, let’s look at postgres and verify that tables were created in our database. You should see them listed here: gatus_uptime&gt;Schemas&gt;public&gt;Tables Once we can seethat tables were created, now lets check out the UI. Gatus is hosted on the default port of 8080. Visit the IP with port in your browser: http://192.168.10.125:8080/ Real World Example Here’s how I monitor my sites: storage: type: postgres path: \"postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@192.168.30.240:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?sslmode=disable\" endpoint-defaults: &amp;defaults group: External interval: 30s client: timeout: 10s conditions: - \"[STATUS] == 200\" - \"[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] &gt; 48h\" endpoints: - name: shop.technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://shop.technotim.com\" - name: technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://technotim.com\" - name: links.technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://links.technotim.com\" - name: l.technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://l.technotim.com\" - name: shop.technotim.com - DNS group: External url: \"8.8.8.8\" # Address of the DNS server to use interval: 5m dns: query-name: \"shop.technotim.com\" query-type: \"A\" conditions: - \"[BODY] == 23.227.38.74\" - \"[DNS_RCODE] == NOERROR\" - name: shop.technotim.com - Ping group: External url: \"icmp://shop.technotim.com\" interval: 1m conditions: - \"[CONNECTED] == true\" - name: Postgres group: Internal url: \"tcp://192.168.30.240:5432\" interval: 30s conditions: - \"[CONNECTED] == true\" Alerts Gatus supports many systems for alerts To keep it simple, we’re going to create a discord alert. First create a webhook in your discord server Then use that hook url in your config We’ll configure some defaults too so we can keep our endpoints tidy like so: alerting: discord: webhook-url: \"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/**********/**********\" default-alert: description: \"Health Check Failed\" send-on-resolved: true failure-threshold: 2 success-threshold: 2 Then you’ll need to update each endpoint with the alert: alerts: - type: discord Or, you can just add it to your anchor which will add it to all endpoint-defaults: &amp;defaults group: External interval: 30s client: timeout: 10s conditions: - \"[STATUS] == 200\" - \"[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] &gt; 48h\" alerts: - type: discord Now let’s create some chaos. Take your site down After 2 time outs we get the alerts Now let’s test recovery Bring Site back up After 2 checks we can see the recovery alert Full config example: storage: type: postgres path: \"postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@192.168.30.240:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?sslmode=disable\" alerting: discord: webhook-url: \"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/**********/**********\" default-alert: description: \"Health Check Failed\" send-on-resolved: true failure-threshold: 2 success-threshold: 2 endpoint-defaults: &amp;defaults group: External interval: 15s client: timeout: 10s conditions: - \"[STATUS] == 200\" - \"[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] &gt; 48h\" alerts: - type: discord endpoints: - name: shop.technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://shop.technotim.com\" - name: technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://technotim.com\" - name: links.technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://links.technotim.com\" - name: l.technotim.com - HTTP &lt;&lt;: *defaults url: \"https://l.technotim.com\" - name: shop.technotim.com - DNS group: External url: \"8.8.8.8\" # Address of the DNS server to use interval: 5m dns: query-name: \"shop.technotim.com\" query-type: \"A\" conditions: - \"[BODY] == 23.227.38.74\" - \"[DNS_RCODE] == NOERROR\" - name: shop.technotim.com - Ping group: External url: \"icmp://shop.technotim.com\" interval: 1m conditions: - \"[CONNECTED] == true\" - name: Postgres group: Internal url: \"tcp://192.168.30.240:5432\" interval: 30s conditions: - \"[CONNECTED] == true\" Join the conversation Over the last few weeks I have been looking for a more advanced self-hosted monitoring system.

From pools, to disk configuration, to cache to networking, backups and more. This guide will walk you through everything you should do after installing TrueNAS with a focus on speed, safety, and optimization. 📺 Watch Video Disclosures: Nothing in this video was sponsored Pool Optimizations I chose Mirrored VDEVs for a few reasons: Upsides Provides redundancy Increased performance Great for small random reads Expansion, much easier than any other raid type You can expand by adding an additional pair This means I only need to buy 2 disks to expand my pool Resilvering is fast Downsides Write performance can be impacted since each write involves updating all VDEVS in a mirror Adding a separate ZIP like an SSD can improve write performance, which we’ll talk about If I lose 2 drives in the same mirror I lose the whole pool Which means that I need to replace disks fast If your pool of mirrored VDEVs is big enough, the chances are less likely to happen 50% capacity loss Datasets Encryption: On Sync: Standard Compression: LZ4 Enabled Atime: Off ZFS Deduplication: Off ARC Adaptive Replacement Cache, this is where data is stored that is frequently accessed along with metadata about the files. Algorithm for adding and evicting data for least recently used. This makes accessing files quicker because it doesn’t need to read from disk and takes the load off those disks so they can do another tasks This isn’t really used for write, that’s ZIL, but some async writes and write directly to ARC There’s a general rule of thumb that you should have 1GB for each TB, however the more the better. One tweak that you might have to do if using ZFS on a Linux system like TrueNAS Scale and that’s adjusting the ARC allocation This is not needed after this patch is released By default linux only allocates 50% You can override this with a quick command while the system is running and then you can also follow that up with a startup command to be sure that this persists between reboots Generally speaking you should let your system run for a few days before making this adjustment as well as running any services and VMs to be sure you don’t over allocate your RAM to ARC. See Tom Lawrence’s Video on this topic Read Speeds To increase read speeds: More RAM More disks / spindles L2ARC Stripe these, even 1 large SSD is good Write Speeds To increase write speeds: More Disks - spinning disks can only read/write at about 150 MB/s Disable Sync write? (No!, not safe) Create SLOG device Should use disks fast that in the pool like SSDs Be sure you have at least a mirror for this This moves ZIL off the main pool, which frees up the pool to do other things Network Considerations LAGG / LACP gives you 2 lanes Gives you redundancy Generally speaking if your switch supports it, a great idea Network and disk speed go hand in hand If your pool can’t read at 10 Gb/s there’s no sense of having 10 gb/s networking If your disks have huge IOSps (think all SSD) your network can’t handle the throughput Somewhere in the middle VLAN Routing Another huge consideration is inter VLAN routing. If you have to cross VLANs, be sure that your switch or router can handle these speeds or you might have to get creative with a dedicated data network that doesn’t traverse VLANs.

If you aren’t aware of the struggles I faced when using the PiKVM with a TESmart switch, all of it is detailed in a previous post where I ended up settling on another switch altogether. That’s all changed now with a simple EDID emulator passthrough adapter (affiliate link). However, for the uninformed, I’ll summarize the symptoms I experienced with the PiKVM and TESmart KVM and how I was able to fix these issues. My Experience When I originally set up my PiKVM (v3 at the time) I wanted to remote control more than one machine. I have a server rack and I rationalized that 8 would be a good number of machines to remote control and ultimately justify the cost of the hardware (cost spread over 8 machines). I also wanted something to rackmount since, after all, I have a server rack. That’s when I found the TESmart 8X1 HDMI KVM Switch 8 (affiliate link). It met all of my requirements: 8 ports Rackmountable Compatible with PiKVM (or so I thought) This device was listed as compatible with PiKVM so I thought it was a safe bet. I have (3) Intel NUC 11th Gen device I planned on connecting to this switch along with an old PC that has a ASUS Z87-PRO motherboard. I figured since they were all Intel based GPUs it was a safe bet. Boy was I wrong… Shortly after configuring the PiKVM with the TESmart KVM and my devices it was clear that something was definitely wrong. As you can see, 1 out of 3 devices work. All 3 are the same model. Usually none of them work even after properly training them. Some of the symptoms were: Black screen without any video When switching machines, you see video but quickly goes to black When switching to some devices, you see a green screen While getting a green screen, the CPU spikes on the PiKVM to where you have to reboot Things I tried I knew this was not good, however I figured it was something that could be fixed in software, after all the PiKVM is open source and running Linux. I did the obvious first, which was training the PiKVM and the TESmart switch according to TESmart’s YouTube video (which is excellent by the way). This kind of helped and by kind of I mean that 1 device would sometimes work but then after adding additional devices it would start experiencing the same symptoms as above. So I thought I could fix it in software… I tried updating the device, testing different EDIDs,and even working with the creator of the PiKVM, Max Devaev, to see if we could tweak any settings to make it work with the TESmart KVM. After capturing logs and EDIDs, Max determined that the EDID was getting “poisoned” with some other EDID when switching. So we decided that it was a hardware issue. I ended up purchasing an EZCOO switch (affiliate link) which ended up working perfectly, albeit not rackmountable. I reached out to TESmart around the same time to see if maybe it was something they had experience in the past, or something that might be addressed in a firmware update. They were great to work with (huge shout out to Ray from TESmart!) and walked me though some additional troubleshooting steps. Each step still yielded the same results. When we exhausted everything we could try, they sent a replacement to see if that might resolve the issue, but sadly it did not. PiKVM v4 and More All of this troubleshooting was done on the PiKVM v3, which I had purchased pretty late in its lifecycle, and v4 was right around the corner. Max from PiKVM said that he felt the issue could be resolved in their v4 model and mentioned he would send one when it launched. I was hopeful that this work. A few months later, the PiKVM v4 Plus arrived on my doorstep. PiKVM v4 Plus &amp; PiKVM v4 Mini After receiving the PiKVM v4 and hooking it up to the TESmart switch I found that I had the same issue as before. This told me it was most likely something with the TESmart switch. I reached out to them again after discovering that I had the 4k 30 fps model and hoped that the 4k 60 fps model would make a difference, after all there were some people who said theirs worked just fine and internet rumors that the 60 fps model worked better. I talked to TESmart again and they shipped a replacement, this time the 4k 60 fps model. I quickly hooked it up and once again experienced all of the same symptoms. I was really puzzled as to why this was happening to me when it works fine with other switches and others claimed to use this switch fine. Community to the Rescue! After testing all of this, I was convinced that I would never be able to use my rackmount KVM. I have to admit that I wasn’t that upset that it didn’t work, I was more upset that I didn’t know when to quit. I was frustrated that I sunk over 80 hours of my time trying to fix this when in fact there was no fix. Sometimes you gotta just let go… That’s when I got lucky and someone posted a comment on my previous post with something new to try. The comment from juristoeckli that mentioned something about an “EDID Emulator”. I had never heard of these before nor was I sure that this was the issue. Then NateDiTo also left a comment about how they had used these EDID emulators (affiliate link) and they worked for them. Finally, I wasn’t alone! Someone else who was experiencing the same thing or at least knew my struggle! That’s when I decided to give it a shot. I told myself “If these don’t work, I am giving up!” and I meant it this time (maybe… 😂). This little device will override your EDID possibly making it compatible with the device it’s connecting to. How I fixed it I purchased a cheaper version of the EDID emulator (affiliate link) hoping they would work. Also, serendipitously, Ray from TESmart had mentioned an EDID emulator in an email that same night. He mentioned this as a last resort, however in my mind this was my last resort. After the devices arrived, I quickly inserted the emulators into the TESmart and connected my machines to them. I plugged them directly into the TESmart switch and all devices started working immediately! I retrained the devices per the video, and sure enough after powering the first one one it worked! I could see my machine in the PiKVM without issues! I quickly tempered my expectations because I have been here before. One device would sometimes work fine, but never more than one. Sure enough after training the next 2 devices it worked fine. I could now control all 3 devices from the PiKVM with the TESmart KVM switch. I tested by rebooting the devices and even the PiKVM and everything still works! They now work as reliably as they did with the EZCOO switch. So why does this work? When I think about the solution, it’s challenging to know how and why this is working. As I understand it, EDID emulators are meant to override a device’s EDID, basically telling the connected device which capabilities it supports. You would think that my devices were sending the proper EDID to the TESmart switch, however as I experienced with 4 devices (2 unique), this was not the case. Some people have mentioned that this happens more often when running Linux, and I even experienced that myself too. When one of my Intel NUCs was running Windows it seemed to work fine but when running Proxmox (Debian Linux) it seemed to experience these issues. This could be a Windows vs. Linux issue, or it could be chalked up to my other experience where 1 device would work fine but none of the others. I’ve tested quite a bit over the span of a year and it’s challenging to know for sure. Oddly enough, this doesn’t happen to everyone who uses TESmart switches. I do think it’s a combination of TESmart + Device + OS/driver that triggers the problem, because again, it works with my with EZCOO switch. I also have a hunch that these emulators might be instructing the device’s GPU to stay powered on even when a device isn’t plugged into it (just like HDMI dummy plugs), however I don’t know if that’s true. If you know, let me know in the comments below! I am considering this “fixed” now even though technically this is a “workaround.” A huge thanks to Max from PiKVM, Ray from TESmart (and the TESmart team), and juristoeckli and NateDiTo in the comments because without all of you I would have given up. Each new idea or additional troubleshooting step motivated me to keep going. I can finally use this switch and recommend it to those who want something rackmountable (with workarounds).

Configure On docker machine, cd into config directory cd config You’ll see yaml files, these are configurations we can edit to configure our homepage edit settings.yaml nano config/settings.yaml --- # For configuration options and examples, please see: # https://gethomepage.dev/latest/configs/settings title: My Awesome Homepage # &lt;----- add this line providers: openweathermap: openweathermapapikey weatherapi: weatherapiapikey Save, exit, and revisit your homepage Should refresh, if not click the refresh in lower right hand corner Title of document should now be My Awesome Homepage If we want, we can also customize the background but updating this file too Edit settings.yaml nano settings.yaml --- # For configuration options and examples, please see: # https://gethomepage.dev/latest/configs/settings title: My Awesome Homepage background: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502790671504-542ad42d5189?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2560&amp;q=80 # &lt;----- add this line providers: openweathermap: openweathermapapikey weatherapi: weatherapiapikey Save and exit again, and the background should be updated. You can also mount your own image rather than reference one on the web however I am going to stick with one from the web that I don’t have to worry about additional mounts and configuration in the future. If we want to add some additional filters to the image using tailwind css, we can like so --- # For configuration options and examples, please see: # https://gethomepage.dev/latest/configs/settings title: My Awesome Homepage background: image: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502790671504-542ad42d5189?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2560&amp;q=80 blur: sm # sm, \"\", md, xl... see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-blur saturate: 50 # 0, 50, 100... see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-saturate brightness: 50 # 0, 50, 75... see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-brightness opacity: 50 # 0-100 # ^^^^ add the above block providers: openweathermap: openweathermapapikey weatherapi: weatherapiapikey If we want to set out homepage to dark mode and the color to slate, we can like: --- # For configuration options and examples, please see: # https://gethomepage.dev/latest/configs/settings title: My Awesome Homepage theme: dark # &lt;----- add this line color: slate # &lt;----- add this line background: image: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502790671504-542ad42d5189?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2560&amp;q=80 blur: sm # sm, \"\", md, xl... see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-blur saturate: 50 # 0, 50, 100... see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-saturate brightness: 50 # 0, 50, 75... see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-brightness opacity: 50 # 0-100 # ^^^^ add the above block providers: openweathermap: openweathermapapikey weatherapi: weatherapiapikey Why do this? Isn’t this a lot of work? 1 word, it’s “repeatable”. We can back up our yaml files and even share them if we want. Also works great with Kubernetes since you can pass a ConfigMap file to your deployment thus not needing a volume. Services Services are configured in service.yaml and really are button for accessing some of your services Edit service.yaml nano config/service.yaml --- # For configuration options and examples, please see: # https://gethomepage.dev/latest/configs/services - My First Group: - My First Service: href: http://localhost/ description: Homepage is awesome - My Second Group: - My Second Service: href: http://localhost/ description: Homepage is the best - My Third Group: - My Third Service: href: http://localhost/ description: Homepage is 😎 - Top Services: - Proxmox: icon: proxmox.png # icons found here https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons href: https://192.168.0.15:8006 description: Proxmox VE - PiHole: icon: pi-hole.svg # icons found here https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons href: http://192.168.60.10/admin description: Server 1 - Cowboy: icon: mdi-account-cowboy-hat-#FF0000 # icons found here https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/ href: https://localhost/ description: giddyup service - McDonald’s: icon: si-mcdonalds-#FFD700 # icons found here https://simpleicons.org/ href: https://www.mcdonalds.com/ description: homepage # ^^^ add this block As you can see we configured 4 services: one that use png images one that used svg images one that use Material Design icons one that used Simple Icons Note: If you’re using Material Design Icons or Simple Icons you can change the color of the icon by appending the hex values to the icon name as shown above. Service Widgets These extend the functionality of service buttons. Optional but cool.

Not sure if this is a feature or a bug, but docker compose up -d --force-recreate will stop the old container, remove it, and create a new one We should now see pi hole statistics Widgets Widgets are standalone items like the resource and search at the top.

It’s a gateway that has WiFi 6 that runs the UniFi network application and can transform into an access point or mesh when your network grows. We’ll be taking a look at this device, its features, how to configure and manage it, and discuss all the uses cases for this versatile device. 📺 Watch Video Disclosures: I was not paid I was sent UniFi Express devices for review What is the UniFi Express? Introducing the UniFi Express This newly released UniFi Express device is here and it’s here to shake up small networks. It’s a device that’s flexible enough to be used in just about any situation and comes in a small compact form factor with a small footprint. It’s a compact device that can act as a gateway and provide WiFI 6 to power your entire network, or can transform into a mesh device to expand your wireless network, or you can add it to an existing network and run it in access point only mode. Yes, it’s that flexible. If you’ve not yet experienced UniFi’s network app and wireless access points, this might be the best entry point for you, and if you’re already using devices in their ecosystem, this can fight seamlessly with your existing network deployments. Specs It has a nice little LCM screen that can display useful information It’s a small compact device that’s all white. It measures about 3 ½ inches long and wide, and sits only about an inch high. It’s made of plastic but has an aluminum bottom, I assume to help dissipate heat. It’s powered by USB C Has 2 network interfaces, a gigabit LAN port and a gigabit WAN port. It has 2x2 2.4 GHz MIMO support and 2x2 5 GHz MIMO support which has a max throughput rate of 573 Mb/s for 2.4 Ghz and 2.4 Gb/s for 5 Ghz. It supports most WiFi standards including WiFi6, and supports the typical WiFi security WPA standards from enterprise all the way up to WPA3. It supports up to 8 unique SSIDS and can service over 60 clients at once, all from this little device. It also has this awesome LCM screen that displays the network status reported by the UniFi network application. Setting up this device is easy too. Setting up / Network App After powering it on you’ll want to adopt this device. It has bluetooth built in so you can adopt it if you have an existing unifi device on your network that also has bluetooth, or even easier from the UniFi network app on your phone. Then you have the choice of setting up a new system, which is what we’ll choose, but you can also add this to an existing system which we’ll talk about later. You’ll name your device and set up WiFi, and then it will set up this device for you automatically. It will prepare the system for a few minutes and after that you’ll be able to connect to your newly created wifi network. Once you’re connected, you can choose to manage the UniFi network via mobile app, or even the web. If you want to manage this from the cloud you can do this easily in the UniFi site manager. Once you land there you should see your UniFi Express ad clicking on that will bring you to the Network manager app. If you’re familiar with the UniFi network app, you’ll feel right at home because it’s the same network application you’re used to with other UniFi products. But if you’re not, we’ll walk through some of the highlights of the application so you can understand how you can use your UniFi express. Dashboard It comes with the UniFi Dashboard This is going to give you a heads up display of your network health and statistics. First we’ll need to turn on dark mode, there that’s better. The dashboard is great for seeing how your network is doing at a glance. From here you can drill into the different aspects of your network or for example if you wanted to see why this device is the most active, you can drill into it, see details and insights about the device, and even test the latency right from here. You can also discover these features using the navigation on the left. Topology Topology shows how data flows through your network Topology will show you your network typology and how each device connects to your network. It also has this cool visualization of how traffic flows through your network, I would watch that all day. UniFi Devices This section shows all of your UniFi devices The unifi devices will just show your unifi devices on the network. This will look pretty bare with only a unifi express but if you have a more complicated network like I do at home, you can visually see how each device is connected. We’ll make this light up a little later with another device, and even create a mesh network with that additional device just waiting to be adopted. Client Devices This section shows all of your client devices, non-UniFi devices In the client devices section you will see all of your client devices, your non unifi devices that are connected to the network. You’ll also see some more details about each device and you can always drill into each to see more information about them. For example we can see that this device here is connected to the unifi express, using WiFI 6, and the connection is excellent. And here, again, you see insights, settings, and even test the latency for the device. Ports This section shows the port manager. The UniFi express only has 2. In the ports section you see the port manager for each device. This is where you can manage the ports on your device. With the unifi express, we only have 2 ports. 1 LAN and One LAN. As far as port management goes on the WAN device, we can only manage the negotiation, but on the LAN side we can manage all aspects of the port. We can rename it, disable it or enable it, we can change the VLAN (if we had more set up, which we’ll do in a bit) Allow or block tagged VLANs, and even some advanced configurations/ Radios This section shows the radio manager. The radios section is where you will get lots of wireless insights. You can see which network you are managing and other information. But if you look at the top this is where you will see some really interesting insights. Coverage is going to show you how dense your network is compared to the clients that are connecting. This is helpful because it will let you know if clients are too far away and if adding another AP is recommended. Connectivity is going to show you if any clients have connectivity issues which is super helpful if some of your clients have issues connecting. This section shows other SSIDs in the area Environment is going to show you all of the other networks in your area. This is really helpful for choosing your network channels for WiFi, something that UniFi can do for you automatically that we’ll see later. And speed tests are where all of your client speed tests are. This is a hidden gem and yet another reason I love UniFi products. WiFiMan is a great app that works with UniFi network application to test your network and save the results They have great mobile apps like WiFi man. WiFI man will help you test your network speeds from the client to the internet, check your WiFI signal, and even help you connect your device to VPN. Once you run a speed test on your device, the results will be stored in the Speed Tests section so you can compare results later. Gateway Gateway shows which clients are using which services across your entire network The gateway section is going to show some of the metrics from your gateway. This includes classification of services being used across your network. You can see which apps, services, and protocols along with the amount of data they are using. System Log In the system log section you can see different types of alerts and logs for your device and even manage push notifications for alerts. Settings In the settings section is where you can find all of the configuration options for your network. WiFi In the wifi section you can create new networks, like a guest network in just a couple of clicks. You have a whole host of options for configuring wireless networks here. One of the other options you might have seen in the WiFi section is the option to optimize now. This option scans for wireless networks and tries to find the best wifi channel for you to use. I would recommend doing this right away, and then again on a schedule which we’ll cover in a bit. Networks In the network sections this is where you will configure some advanced options like VLANs. I won’t cover this here because I’ve already covered this in depth in a video, but this is where you would do it. Internet The internet section is for configuring some of your WAN options, things like static IP addresses, dynamic DNS, and others can be configured here. VPN The next section is for VPN and that’s where this device really gets awesome, not that it wasn’t already, but you can set up Teleport, which is UniFi’s 0 configuration VPN we talked about earlier with the WiFi Man app which will allow you to create a VPN connection just by sending a link. It’s super handy. If you don’t want to go that route you have your more traditional methods for doing that, with WireGuard, OpenVPN, and L2TP. You can also configure this to be a VPN client of another network, or set up a site to site VPN connecting this network to another network. Again, these are the same options you see across all unifi devices that support the UniFi network app. Security In the security section you do see a slight difference between this device and some of their other devices. This device does have IDS and IPS so you’re going to see any configuration options there. IDS and IPS will help detect and block different security volitions based on rules and heuristics. You do see this option on devices like the UDM pro but it’s missing on this device. I think the reason for this is: cost performance make it more modular It seems they are breaking this up a bit but we’ll cover this a little later. But here we can configure general security including ad blocking and country blocking, traffic rules that can apply to different categories, port forwarding, probably the most important thing in this section, firewall rules for your VLANs and your WAN. Routing We also have routing which is for creating static routes Profiles Profiles where you get to create groups and settings that can be applied to ports, speed limits, RADIUS users, and IPs. System And lastly in System we can change UI settings, schedule automatic updates, schedule automatic backups, and turn on some additional services in the advanced section. Who is this for Meshing Use Cases After looking at all of the features that are supported in the UniFi network application and those that aren’t, you might be wondering who this device is for. The more I thought about this the more use cases I came up with! Small Business / Small Networks First of all, it’s obvious that this is for any small business that wants a low cost but powerful network management with WiFi 6. It lets you create and manage a new site with vpn capabilities for a fraction of the cost of a typical deployment and on top of that it gives you WiFi 6. It then allows you to expand the network by adding additional switches and other UniFi access points. And if that site expands in the future, you can add additional UniFi Express devices that can act as an access point only and even mesh mode. That’s right, if you adopt this device to a network that already has a network controller running it will run in access point mode allowing you to extend your wifi range. Existing Networks This also works for existing UniFi networks. Say for instance you have a network set up already and want to add a simple, small access point, you can plug this in, adapt it to your existing network, and have a wifi range extender in minutes. Remote Workers This is great for remote workers too, since it can connect back to your corporate network with a VPN connection. Home Network UniFi express is an easy recommendation for home use This could also be used at home for the home user. It’s more device than most will even need at home but provides a simple way to create a mesh network at home. You can start with one and expand as you need. And a majority of home users only use wireless anyway so the fact that it only has one network port is fine for most people. Mesh Network for Expansion This also applies to anyone that has a Dream Router that wants to add some more coverage to their network without running ethernet cables and worrying about Power over ethernet. With an express you just plug one of these in, mesh it, and you’ve expanded your network. This is really helpful if you also have UniFi Protect Wireless cameras or DoorBells that aren’t near your router. Remote Tech Support And a few personal use cases that I’ve thought about are installing one of these at my family’s house for the occasional remote support that comes up every now and then. This makes troubleshooting their networks remotely so much easier than walking them through it. Travel Router This might replace my travel router… time will tell And lastly something that I plan to use this for is for my travel router. I’ve always wanted a UniFi device that’s small enough to travel with that provides secure access back to my home. Now I know that’s super specialized but it’s something that I’ve been trying to build on my own for quite some time. UniFi Express is Versatile UniFi express is a great way to expand your network The more I think about this device the more use cases I come up with, from the first time home user that wants reliable WiFi at home, to the “pro-sumer” at home that wants to dip their toes in the UnFi ecosystem at a budget, to the company that wants to give a small remote site wifi access and the ability to expand while still managing their network, to the remote user that wants access back to their corporate LAN without a bunch of network gear in their home, to me, the odd ball, who just wants to bring a device with them when the travel so that all devices can securely connect back to home. I am sure there are plenty more use cases I missed, so let me know your thoughts in the comments below. Well I learned a ton about the net UniFi Express, how to mesh wireless networks, and I hope you learned something too, and remember if you found anything in this post helpful, don’t forget share with a friend!

It brings a lot of unique features and was built and designed with the HomeLab community in mind. In this in-depth review we’ll cover everything you want to know about this new storage server. 📺 Watch Video Disclosures: I was not paid I was sent an HL15 for review Intro HL15 from 45HomeLab This is the newly released HL15 from 45 Homelab division of 45 Drives. It’s a server meant to meet the needs of the HomeLab community while bringing the build quality and design from their enterprise offerings. It’s a 15 bay server that can be used for just about whatever you want to use it for but it goes without saying that you’re most likely thinking about buying this to be your next storage server. There’s a lot to unpack with this new server so this will be an in-depth look at the H15 HomeLab Storage Server. We’ll cover everything from the chassis, the backplane, the motherboard, the CPU, the power supply and power consumption, cooling, software selection, and even the price and value proposition, because at the end of the day if you don’t think it’s worth it, you’re probably not going to buy it. So, is it any good? Let’s find out. Purchasing Options When purchasing this machine you have a few options. Now you might have sticker shock when seeing these prices, but we’ll talk about that later in the video. But your options are: Chassis &amp; backplane only Chassis, backplane, PSU, Data Cables, and PSU or fully loaded and tested which is the machine that they sent to me for testing. You have your choice of color, power cable, and additional add ons if you like. They sent a white for me, which is what I was hoping for. First let’s dive into the chassis and the case. Chassis / Case Steel chassis with screws. I really dig the white and blue This chassis is made of steel and it’s solid. Like really solid. If you’ve only had aluminum cases in the past you’ll notice the difference right away. It has a powder coat finish that comes in white or black, mine is obviously in white. This design is really nice, it has sort of this Star Wars Hoth vibe to it, which I am a fan of. Now looking at this case you can see that it’s almost entirely metal metal and screws, which I think is a good thing. Why does that matter? We’ll, if you’ve ever had a rivet pop off of one of your cases it’s near impossible to fix, at least for me, I’ve never used rivets and wouldn’t know where to start. You can open this case up using these thumb screws and the first thing you see is the top loading drive cage. Holds 15 drives that can easily slide in and out, easy to see serial numbers (no more labels) and has these nice little springs to keep the drives in place. You’ll also notice No caddies, which is something 45 Drives does not like and after loading quite a few drives in other systems I think it’s starting to rub off on me. Caddies just add more parts, more screws, and ultimately more time and complexity when servicing drives. It’s something that I can now appreciate after dealing with the status quo for so many years. The back of the chassis is pretty basic, I do wish it used PCIe blanks vs breakaways One of the downsides is that the PCIe slots have breakaways. Great if you never need to add an item (less parts, less screws, less things banging around) but awkward if you do shuffle around hardware. This is a carry over from their enterprise servers, something I also have in my AV15. The other nice thing about this case is that it can lay flat or even stack up like a desktop with the included feet. If you’re choosing to rack mount this, you’ll just need to attach the included rack ears and then also pick up a pair of rack rails, which do not come with the server. If you don’t want the official rack rails, one of the universal rack shelves will work just fine. Motherboard &amp; Connectivity Lots of this connectivity options on this motherboard We’ll go a little more in depth on the backplane and some of its features a little bit later but let’s first focus on the motherboard and connectivity to help you understand how it all works. This motherboard is the SuperMicro X11SPH-nCTPF. It comes in 2 flavors, one with SFP+ networking and the other with 10Gbe networking. X11SPH-nCTF https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/motherboard/x11sph-nctpf CPU &amp; RAM This is an intro level Xeon, great for PCIe lane, storage services, and a few containers or VMs but not too much after that Single Socket LGA-3647 Motherboard Up to 28 cores we’ll cover the specific CPU a little bit later Up to 2 TB of RAM across the 8 DIMM slots DDR4-3200 Dual Rank ECC Registered RAM I opted for 32 GB of 2x16 and picked up more RAM from eBay and now have 128GB. It’s priced pretty fairly there if you’re thinking about buying some. I made sure that I tested it and it all passed If you do decide to do this, be sure to populate your DIMs in dual rank mode according to the motherboard manual. SATA / SAS If you’re looking at the specs and read 10 SATA, that’s because it has 8 SATA ports and 2 SATA DOM. 7 SAS wired up to backplane, along with 8 SATA. 2 SATA DOM for OS or something else. NVMe on onboard. Mine came with a Kingston drive. Can support 2 more via OCuLink (u.2 spec) which I am not sure where you would put the drives but it’s possible. https://store.supermicro.com/supermicro-55cm-oculink-to-u-2-pcie-with-power-cable-cbl-sast-0956.html You can also look for SuperMicro NVMe add-on cards if you need more NVMe. (Where to Buy section) PCIe 4 PCIe 3.0 slots: 16x, 8x, 8x, 4x in 8x slot They are 3.0 3.0 is 1 GB/s and 4.0 is 2 GB/s but real world not sure if you’re notice This gives you plenty of room for expandability Backplane Custom backplane created by 45 drives. It can address up to 15 drives. They’ve wired up 8 to SATA and 7 to SAS The 8 SATA run though the C622 onboard controller 6 GB ports 7 SAS run through the Intel 3008 controller 12 GB/s ports Can push up to 2,000 MB /s? You can saturate a 10g link easily with this much storage Basically NVMe speeds over the network This backplane has some custom features. It’s the same backplane that they put in their enterprise Storinators they just developed Universal Hot Swap Power limiting features so that when plugging in drives it won’t affect its neighbors voltage Staggered spin up Staggers the spin up of the hard drives Starting all at the same time can create a surge I think this is why one of my old JBOD servers trips my power supply when I power it on. Power Supply The HL15 has a modest power supply. Great for 15 drives but might need some additional wattage if you’re going to add more components Rm750e from Corsair ATX, Fully Modular make sure that you only use the cables you need reducing clutter in the case. This is welcomed because when swapping out the power supply in my AV15 there were lots of cables and it was a specialized power supply. Great to see they are using a standard ATX now. Low noise because of its 120mm fan, and can even spin down to 0 RPMs on low loads. It also has an 80 plus gold certified rating meaning that it’s up to 90% efficient at steady loads. Could you get a more efficient one, sure, but it’s going to cost a lot more. Overall solid power supply but 750w might not leave too much headroom if you’re planning on adding all 15 drives and some additional components. Networking Dual 10g SFP+ ports I went this route because I feel like it’s a little more flexible than going 10g ethernet I ended up buying a few 10g RJ45 transceivers to connect to 10g ethernet on my switch (Where to Buy section) IPMI IPMI onboard typical ASPEED IPMI you need on SuperMicro boards Works great for getting into your machine when it’s powered down or before it has an OS. I used it to flash the BMC and firmware shortly after getting it powered on. I did buy the remote license update from SuperMicro, which I typically do with all my boards that allows you to flash bios through the UI. It costs about 27 bucks and while it stinks to pay for this license, there’s no easy way around it if you do want to flash your BIOS remotely or want access to some of the other features. Misc There are lots of additional headers on the board if you need, like TPM, USB, and even additional serial. IO VGA, which honestly doesn’t matter since you have IPMI, but this is pretty typical with servers USB 2 and 3.0 ports, network again, and serial. Overall, I think this is a solid server board for this configuration. CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) Bronze 3204 CPU @ 1.90GHz https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/193381/intel-xeon-bronze-3204-processor-8-25m-cache-1-90-ghz.html 2nd gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors Cascade Lake 6 Cores, no Hyper-threading Max clock 1.9, low for single thread performance but fine for me Can address up to 48 PCIe lanes which is great for the board we have TDP 85w VTx, VtD, AES-NI and more of the typical tech you see in Xeon CPUs Real world, is the CPU enough? It is for me. I will be doing very little compute on this server. If you plan on using this as a hypervisor like Proxmox, you might want to look into another CPU. I checked other CPU options on the used market and it’s actually not to bad if you want to upgrade this CPU later on down the road. Power Consumption &amp; Efficiency Turning it on without anything plugged in it’s going to pull about 80 watts of power while doing system tests and if you plug in a few additional USB devices, the monitor, a couple of GBICs it’s going to pull an additional 10. When fully booted into Ubuntu 22.04 LTS without anything plugged in it’s going to pull about 70 watts. The only drives I had free to test with here these 8TB Seagate Ironwolf 7200 RPM NAS drives After inserting each drive and letting them spin up and normalizing, each drive added about an additional 8-9 watts of power. After inserting 6 without anything else plugged in, we’re sitting at about 114 watts After pulling in the 2 10g transceivers and the IPMI nic, we’re sitting at right around 125 watts. Not too bad all things considered. I disconnected the fans just to see and it looks like they are using about 4 watts a a piece Cooling 6 x 120mm CoolerGuys fans 1700 RPM 32.5dBA 73CFM - cubic feet per minute 2.47mm H2O - static pressure (measures in inches of water) 6 of these total 3 in the front to take in cool air and cool the drives and another 3 to push air across the motherboard and keep components cool. These fans move a lot of air and you don’t need to worry about your components ever overheating. They do this at the cost of noise though. How loud are the fans? I am not sure how to put this but they are quiet for enterprise servers and loud for a home server. They are much quieter than its enterprise counterpart, the AV15, but still not something you want to put in your living room. I am thinking about replacing them with Zigbee controller RGB fans like I did with my AV15 customization video but haven’t had the time to rip it apart yet. If you do decide to replace the fans, just be sure that you’re getting something on par with these and specifically ones with enough static pressure. The CPU cooler is passive and I think that has a lot to do with why they’re using these fans. On my AV15 I did swap this out for a noctua cpu cooler that kept it just as cool, if not more, which then allowed me to replace the fans with quieter fans. You can find the fans I used in the AV15 in the Where to Buy section. OS &amp; Software The HL15 ships with Rocky Linux but I assume that’s there just to run their QA tests. Since this is an open system x86 you can install anything you like on it from Proxmox, to TrueNAS, VMware or any operating system. If you’re buying this as a storage server, most likely it’s going to be something that handles storage nicely. I took a slightly different approach with this system and decided to not install a hypervisor and install Ubuntu LTS. This time I am going to go bare metal and see how manageable Ubuntu is with services like SMB, NFS, ZFS, some docker containers, and possibly some KVM if I want virtualization. I am also going to give Cockpit a shot, or the Houston UI as 45Drives calls it. This gives me a friendly UI to manage some of these services which are otherwise pretty complex. That’s when I found out that they don’t yet support 22.04, only 20.04 which is the previous LTS from 3 years ago. With all of that being said, I am going to install Cockpit without the 45Drives special sauce. This was super simple with a command… Or so I thought… And that had its own issues so for the sake of showing off what Cockpit / Houston can do I decided to install Ubuntu 20.04, which is still supported. Hopefully 22.04 will be supported, or even 24.04 in the spring. Installing is as easy as downloading a script and then executing it. It will install many different modules to help you manage your server. After setup is complete you’ll reboot. Once installed you can see Houston or Cockpit running on your server IP https 9090 At the time of testing Houston for this video, it seems like some of these modules are not working properly with the HL15, for example the 45Drives Disks and the 45Drives Motherboard do not load, and the 45Drives System area is partially loaded and there are some services that fail to load like ZnapZend. These few things aside, the rest of the UI seems to be working. I can create ZFS pools, create SMB and NFS Shares, and even create some virtual machines if I like, although the UI is pretty basic for this. Creating users, Charts, metrics, benchmarks, and even accessing the terminal all seem fine. You can also install additional applications by using the cli and finding an application on their project page however most of them are already installed. For example I installed and open LDAP server on my machine and that worked just fine, however beta applications like Tailscale and cloudflare tunnels aren’t available on this version of cockpit so you won’t be able to install them, arguably that’s probably better suited for something like Docker and containers, and if you’re going to install manage containers, you’ll want to install Portainer to manage them. If I do end up going this route, I would leave Cockpit for managing hardware type services and configuration and leave the rest to Docker and I will manage Docker with Portainer since it’s only a few clicks away. All that being said, I know that this is a new line for 45 drives, but it would be nice if this were working so that I wouldn’t be forced to use proxmox because I don’t need virtualization, and TrueNAS because I don’t want to run their apps. I might just go bare metal without any gui, but managing configs for smb, zfs, zfs, etc is such a pain. So more to come on the OS for this server, I still have time to make my decision and the nice thing is it’s flexible! Hardware &amp; Network Stress Test The HL15 with a standard config can easily push 20 G/bs You’ll have to see the video for this section. Spoiler alert, I can push 20 Gb/s with this configuration, no problem at all. Price &amp; Value One of the first products that is targeting the HomeLab community So let’s talk about some of the configuration options you saw earlier along with the value you’re getting. You can choose: Chassis + Backplane for $799 which is going to get you the chassis with the direct wire backplane. Everything else is up to you to supply and connect. The next option at $910.00 is the Chassis + Backplane &amp; PSU which is going to get you the chassis, the direct wire backplane, data cables, and the 750w ATX power supply. The final option for $1999.99 is the fully built and tested system. Let’s not beat around the bush, all of these options are priced pretty high. No matter which way you look at it, $800, $900, $2,000 dollars is a lot of money no matter what you are spending it on and I think you have to determine if there’s enough value here for you. Is getting a steel, repairable case with a backplane that can hold 15 caddie-less drives and give you NVMe speeds over the network important to you? If it is, you have few options out there. This isn’t a chassis you buy that comes with a proprietary motherboard and components, it’s a chassis that is open enough to accommodate any motherboard / CPU combination you throw at it, now and in the future. If you’re comparing it to other storage vendors, like synology, it’s on par for price, but if you’re comparing it to old used gear you’re going to think it’s expensive. That being said, I would love to see cheaper options for those that are in the market for a homelab chassis like this one. And if not, maybe they will see these on the second hand market later in life. If you can get past the price, I think you’ll find a case that has everything you’re going to want for a storage server, now and in the future. It looks like 45Drives addressed everything I mentioned in the AV15 with the HL15, well, except RGB, unless you’re counting the power switch. Also, I have to give them credit because they took a huge risk at bringing something to market that is as niche as HomeLab, because to my knowledge, they are one of the first to do it and brand it with the “HomeLab” Title. Well I learned a lot about the HL15, storage servers, and network throughput testing and I hope you learned something too. And remember if you found anything in this video helpful, don’t forget share this post! Join the conversation After a week of using and testing the HL15, I finally released my in-depth review of this new storage server.

DHCP Configuration Since I cannot cover configuring every DHCP service out there, I will cover the basics. Fortunately linuxserver.io has many routers covered as well as the official netboot.xyz docs. UniFi UDM Pro / SE Settings &gt; Network &gt; Choose Network &gt; DHCP Service Management &gt; Show Options Here you’ll want to check “Network Boot” and fill in the server IP and the file name For me, it’s: Server IP: 192.168.10.125 Filename: netboot.xyz.kpxe (this is the default BIOS option) Save. Preferably we would like to offer a PXE boot per architecture, and UDM supports it however not in the UI. Follow these instructions to do it via CLI If you’re up to it, here’s my config: # # Generated automatically by # # Configuration of PXE boot for ' # The boot filename, Server name, Server Ip Address dhcp-boot=netboot.xyz.kpxe,netboot.xyz,192.168.10.125 # inspect the vendor class string and match the text to set the tag dhcp-vendorclass=BIOS,PXEClient:Arch:00000 dhcp-vendorclass=UEFI32,PXEClient:Arch:00006 dhcp-vendorclass=UEFI,PXEClient:Arch:00007 dhcp-vendorclass=UEFI64,PXEClient:Arch:00009 # Set the boot file name based on the matching tag from the vendor class (above) dhcp-boot=net:UEFI32,netboot.xyz.efi,netboot.xyz,192.168.10.125 dhcp-boot=net:BIOS,netboot.xyz.kpxe,netboot.xyz,192.168.10.125 dhcp-boot=net:UEFI64,netboot.xyz.efi,netboot.xyz,192.168.10.125 dhcp-boot=net:UEFI,netboot.xyz.efi,netboot.xyz,192.168.10.125 Verify cat /run/dnsmasq.conf.d/PXE.conf Copy file to /run/dnsmasq.conf.d/PXE.conf on UDM run kill `cat /run/dnsmasq.pid` You’ll have to do this on each reboot If you don’t want to do this, you’ll have to change the image file each time. Booting to network To boot to the network you’ll need a BIOS and NIC that supports it enable in BIOS enable EFI PXE Boot enable Legacy (BIOS) PXE Boot Figure out boot override or network boot key Power on and boot to network (BIOS of EFI) See the boot menu, choose OS and go! Word of caution, there might be some that do not work. This is a moving target. e.g. Ubuntu 23.10 isn’t working for me now, but could soon. Other OS are fine. You may need to try different NICs if you are using virtualization What about Windows? Requirements Windows 10/11 machine Windows ISO Windows ADK for Windows 10/11 Windows PE add-on for the Windows ADK Windows 11 ADK downloads here Install Windows ADK for Windows 10/11. Install Windows PE add-on for the Windows ADK. Run Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment as administrator from the start menu.

You can create or download a Windows ISO by visiting Microsoft’s site Once you have created your Windows ISO, you can then extract the files to the root of the Windows share you just created above. Now we need to configure netboot.xyz In netboot.xyz UI, update boot.cfg to set win_base_url http://192.168.10.125:8080/WinPE and save. Now you can PXE boot to the network (be sure you are using the EFI boot image and your device supports UEFI) and then choose Windows from the netboot.xyz menu. This should boot to a DOS prompt in the Windows Pre-boot Environment Type wpeinit then type net use F: \\\\&lt;server-ip-address&gt;\\&lt;share-name&gt; /user:&lt;server-ip-address&gt;\\&lt;username-if-needed&gt; &lt;password-if-needed&gt; If you want it to prompt for a username and password, remove the user argument net use F: \\\\&lt;server-ip-address&gt;\\&lt;share-name&gt; This will map the F: drive to your Windows share that the Windows ISO extracted then type F:\\setup.exe Then hit enter and Windows installer should launch! I’d love to also automate the mounting of the share however I haven’t found a clean way to do it yet. If you know, let me know in the comments below and I can add it! Join the conversation Back in my tech support days I thought that if I had PXE network boot at home, that I &quot;made it&quot;. We&#39;ll, that day has come!

It looks familiar yet different. It stands out among the others in the sea of familiar devices and once you use it and hold it in your hands you understand why it’s different and why that matters. This is the ZimaBlade, a single board computer from Ice Whale. It’s the second device we’ve seen from them and it’s much different from their first device, the ZimaBoard. There are a few features that make you think that this might be a successor to the ZimBoard, but there are many others which show that the ZimaBlade can stand on its own as a new product in their lineup. Today I am taking a look at the ZimaBlade and discussing some of my thoughts around this device, how it compares to the ZimaBoard, and some of the interesting quirks I found that you might be interested in. Unbox Experience ZimaBlade looks like a Walkman from the 80s, and that’s a good thing Upon opening you can’t help but notice the cyber punk theme on the packaging and the device. I am a fan of this design and it fits right in with the renegade, self-hosting, cyber native vibe they are going for. Next, they chose to make the case transparent, which again plays well with the theme they have going and gives this device some character. And last, how much it looks like a Walkman from the 80s. Now that’s not a bad thing, Walkmans had a ton of style, came in all shapes and sizes, and was an icon in 80s culture. But I digress. Hardware Specs ZiaBlade without its case The ZimaBlade comes with either an Intel Celeron J3455 Quad core Apollo Lake processor or an Intel Celeron Dual core processor depending on which model you choose. This CPU supports AES NI for encryption, VT-x for virtualization, and VT-d for directed I/O or hardware passthrough. This processor is paired with the Intel integrated HD 500 graphics processor which is clocked at around 700 Mhz. This chip also supports QuickSync and a handful of other features that help ensure that video playback is smooth as well as enough processing power to do some lightweight retro gaming. You output the video with this mini display port that supports up to 4k at 60Hz. It has a SODIMM slot that supports up to 16 GB of DDR3 RAM which is removable and not soldered on. As far as storage goes it has 32GB eMMC for storage and dual SATA 3.0 ports for connecting additional drives if you choose to do so. It has a 1 Gb ethernet port and as far as USB goes it has one USB A 3.0 port and one USB C port that supports power, data, and display. The back of this case is also aluminum alloy that is fused to the heatsink which will help dissipate heat without a fan, Last but not least is this bump you see here and that’s the PCIe 2.0 x4 slot. This slot is what made the ZimaBoard unique, was not only creating an x86 single board computer but also including a PCI slot to connect devices that you can’t use on other mini PCs, laptops, or similar devices without using a Thunderbolt enclosure. And as you can see the ZimaBlade also gets this slot. This slot can be used for almost any PCIe device you can think of that can fit into a 4x slot and doesn’t require external power. This includes things like 10g network adapters, 2.5g network adapters, additional USB ports, WiFi 6 adapters, additional SATA ports, NVMe adapters, cards and for AI and ML. First Boot experience ZimaBlade with its case, showing off some of its ports After installing the RAM and plugging in the device you will boot into Debian Linux which comes preinstalled. You can sign in using the username and password of casaos. You’ll want to change this as soon as possible and update your system. You might want to grab the IP too because you’ll need it to get into the CasaOS web UI that also comes preinstalled. CasaOS is an open source management interface to help you install over 50 docker apps with a single click along with supporting any other docker image you can find. It makes setting up a NAS with Docker apps a snap and great for a beginner although if you’re already familiar with other open source NAS solutions you might be missing some features when evaluating CasaOS. If you’re interested in a deeper dive into what CasaOS is, I’ve done a video on 20 different projects you can run on your ZimaBoard and now ZimaBlade, including CasaOS. One thing that was mentioned in the instructions, yes I read them, if you go out to you can easily find your Zima device by clicking this button. Now this didn’t work for me even though my devices were on the same network but that might be because this feature isn’t ready yet. You’ll also see that they have released Windows and Mac clients too. After downloading and installing these clients you’ll notice that it also installs ZeroTier. Again, there isn’t documentation on this stuff yet because it’s pretty new but it looks like they might allow you to connect to your Zima device easily over the internet no matter where you are and if you have an edge connection or not. This might be for the upcoming ZimaOS that I peeped on their Github. Oh and if you’re worried about the code or client that’s running, all of this is open source and on GitHub so you’re free to check it out if you don’t trust it. My Workbench Testing System PCIe connectivity is often not found on mini PCs The nice thing about this hardware being open is that you are not locked into how the vendor wants to use it. If you don’t like Debian or CasaOS, fine, just wipe it and install whatever you like. Want to build your own NAS using OpenMediaVault or TrueNAS, go for it. Just get a bootable flash drive, install it, connect a couple of drives and you’re good to go. If you do go this route I would recommend picking up the NAS kit that includes this dual 3.5” storage drive stand and a special Y SATA cable that helps you connect and power 2 additional drives. And just like that you have a NAS…. or do what I did and create a dual boot Windows and Linux system! I use both Windows and Linux a ton on my workbench and I always find myself toggling back and forth when testing hardware. Plugging in When I saw the ZimaBlade had a case for 2 additional drives I knew right away that this is how I was going to use it. I grabbed a few old SSDs out of my drawer, picked up a couple of cheap 3.5 to 2.5” drive adapters, installed the drives, and then connected them all with this Y SATA splitter and it was ready to go. Installing a dual boot system on this was relatively easy however I’ve had some experience with this in past and I even did a video on it, but if you’re interested on how to do this I will have a link to my documentation that will explain exactly how to do dual boot with a ZimaBlade. Now when booting I can choose Windows or Linux when booting up. You can see that this little quad core processor is working its tail off during the boot process but it tapers off after a few seconds. The integrated intel video card works decent enough for watching videos and I assume it works fine too for retro games but this is just enough for what I need to test out hardware and flash and wipe drives. This device can boot into Windows 11 and play videos, no problem! On the Windows side it’s using anywhere from 6-10 watts of power after signing in and letting the machine sit for about 5 minutes to ensure that most sign in tasks were complete. This variance we see here is due to a lot of the background tasks that run on Windows and a little bit for the task manager. When launching the default browser of Edge and playing a video on YouTube we can see the power usage jump from 10–18 watts. The other thing when looking at the task manager is that the integrated graphics have kicked in to decode the video. If we look at the stats for nerds there were only a few dropped frames and most of them were when starting the video and resizing the window to full screen. It’s no surprise that this also works with Linux! (Ubuntu 23.10 shown in picture) The same goes for Linux, when booting this Ubuntu 23.10 machine the machine I can choose Linux from the GRUB menu and boot into Ubuntu Desktop and as you can see the CPU and resources taper off after a few seconds and everything runs smoothly. Power usage after letting the machine sit for about 5 minutes is anywhere between 5 - 7 watts, again the variance is due to background tasks and System Monitor. Playing a YouTube video with the default browser of Firefox we can see the power usage jump from 11 - 17 watts. System monitor doesn’t report GPU status so I installed intel gpu utilities and was able to see the intel video card decoding the video. One of the things I use this for most often is flashing SSDs and wiping and formatting drives. These two things are pretty cumbersome to do without physically plugging them into a system via SATA, PCIe, or Thunderbolt. Each of these solutions take up a lot of space or require additional hardware requirements. I found that having an “open air” PCIe slot on this machine makes it super simple to test complete any of these tasks, and with a small footprint. And this is just one of many possibilities with the ZimaBlade because at the end of the day, it’s really just a mini desktop. My Thoughts About the ZimaBlade The engineering sample came with a white PCB, let’s hope it sticks around I do have some thoughts after using this for a couple of days. Overall it’s great and hard to complain about something when there’s so much to like. I think my biggest gripe has been power. I went into this thinking that I can use any USB C power adapter since it supports Power Delivery 3.0. Turns out that this is a 12v Power Delivery 3.0 power supply and I couldn’t find any power adapters here at home that supported it, not my Macbook charger, an Anker charger, or even this no-name charger. This really isn’t a big deal however if I used one of my existing adapters, it seemed to also do something weird to the device to where I had to reset the CMOS a few times. I reached out to IceWhale and they pointed out that I needed to use a Power Delivery 3.0 12v/3a power adapter like the one that is included. I 100% agree that the provided adapter works but USB C Power Delivery 3.0 with 12v/3a is less common in North America with a lot of power adapters, at least the ones I have access to. IceWhale did say that they were going to try to make it compatible with more adapters before production so we’ll see. Moral of the story is just use the adapter they ship and you’ll be fine, which means you might want to buy their power adapter to be sure. When using the correct power adapter with a USB C hub, everything worked fine including USB, HDMI, and power delivery. Another small gripe is that you can’t see the power LED when you have it in the case. The only reason I am bringing this up is because I had to check the LED over and over when figuring out the previous issue related to power. Not a big deal but one little hole or clear cutout in the case would go a long way. While we’re on the topic of LEDs it would be nice to have a pair of lights for the NIC for status and activity and also I noticed that the HD activity light doesn’t flash for eMMC. Again, not deal breakers, just nice to haves. Also a small power button would have been awesome. I still feel odd pulling out the power to reset or power down this machine. I did check for pins and I could only make out the reset switch. It would be great to add these pins to the documentation, I am sure others will ask about this if they haven’t already, and everything else is documented nicely in the booklet that shipped with the device. Oh, and they sent me 2 devices, one was an engineering sample with a white PCB and one that is closer to the final product which has a black PCB. Honestly I love the white PCB model even though I am a huge fan of dark mode! This white PCB just makes it feel more SciFi and futuristic and really makes all of the componentry pop. I dunno, what do you think? Light Mode PCB or Dark Mode? Hopefully some printed caddies or the like make their way into the ecosystem Also, it would be cool if there were some sort of printable adapter to prop up your PCIe devices when they are plugged in. When you aren’t using the 2 drive base stand it’s easy to prop something under it, but when it’s dangling about 6 inches up it’s kind of scary. A printable tray or stand that could hook into the existing stand would go a long way. You could even sprinkle in some of the Cyber Punk designs from the device. OK it sounds like I am nitpicking now but these are just small things that I think would really put some polish on this device. It’s hard to complain when there’s so much to like about this $64 board. I know that it has an older CPU in it, along with DDR3, and the PCI is only 2.0, but considering the cost and what I will use it for I would rather keep the cost down than pay for features I personally won’t use. And I think that’s the goal of this device as stated by IceWhale: “The ZimaBoard was built on top of a relatively expensive ($120-$200) x86 single-board computer compared with the popular Raspberry Pi. Since most people can’t afford such expensive hardware without knowing what exactly it can do, we decided to create something better suited for the broader cyber native – something that is cheaper, smaller, and easier to use and carry around.” If this is something you want to support, check out the links for more information: ZimaBlade on CrowdSupply: https://bit.ly/3PeSpxv ZimaBlade Official Site: https://bit.ly/3tOlpUx Well I learned a lot about the new ZimaBlade, Power Delivery over USB C, Dual Booting Windows and Linux and I hope you learned something too.

Monitors Samsung 57” Ultrawide and my Dell 4k monitor! Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 57” Dual 4k UHD Dual 4k means they put 2 4k panels together 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time I don’t need this at all, 120Hz is great but what I really wanted was a specific ratio. Ratio is Important to me because I wanted to have a 16:9 ratio so that I could put 2 windows side by side and have them each be 4k, or one large one for editing One other cool thing is that it has a 1000R curve, which for me I think is one of the best curves, although I haven’t used any other. This makes it feel more natural where the monitor is almost equidistant as I move my head when looking left and right. So how do you hold up a 40 lbs monitor? Very carefully. Took a while to find the right arm, since most monitor arms max out at about 30-40 lbs. Ended up finding one that supports 44 lbs and it’s working great. I did this so I can adjust and and because the legs are gigantic It has RGB, kind of pointless unless someone is sitting behind you and you want to annoy them. I only have it on for this video. Also, this arm has RGB too, which I promise is not the reason I bought it. It can be toggled off too. Dell U2720Q 27” 4k IPS Panel You might be wondering why I have this when I have a gigantic monitor below? This is great when sharing my screen on zoom calls or when I do screen recordings for my videos so that I don’t have to share a super wide desktop that no one can see or have to only share a section of my screen. I typically have it off until I need to do one of those things. Desk Organization Grovemade Having a desk system like this one from Grovemade freed up a lot of space on my desk Designed and made in Portland, Oregon Simple materials - wood, aluminum, cork 46 inches wide, 9 inches deep Solid maple - warm, natural look Desk Shelf - Large Maple Also opted for a tray to store some things. This gives me 3 layers to store things that need to be out of the way but still have quick access to. I also went with this light gray desk pad. This is my first real desk pad and I have to say, I think this one is perfect. It has a great modem look, it’s just wide and deep enough, and it’s super smooth with some cushion. My mouse slides so easily on it with the perfect amount of friction, it’s hard to explain but I really feel like this material helps me be more precise when using my mouse at the crazy high DPI I have it set at.

This all changed when I found a way to not only rackmount my Mac, but add PCIe slots to add additional components like NVMe SSDs, video capture cards, dual 10 gig networking, and even testing a video card. Thank you to Sonnet for sending this xMac Studio / Echo III / M.2 8x4 Silent Gen4 PCIe Card to help complete my video editing / software development Machine! Disclosures: I was not paid I chose Sonnet and contacted them after researching alternatives SSDs are on loan and will be sent back Thinking about expanding your Mac/Windows/Linux Machines? Check out Sonnet! 📺 Watch Video More than a Rackmount Case I racked my Mac Studio using this rackmount case and it gives me so many connectivity options. It not only serves as a rackmount but it also expands its capabilities by adding a Thunderbolt enclosure that can fit 3 full length PCIe cards and connects over Thunderbolt 3 or 4. This unlocks the Mac’s full potential by allowing you to connect PCIe cards like network adapters, video capture cards, or even add super fast storage using this 16x PCIe card that can fit up to 8 NVMe SSD drives. the xMac Studio rackmount case also has a built-in USB hub, cut outs that still let you access the IO ports, an easy to reach out button, and even an area to keep USB or Thunderbolt drives if you’ve decided to connect those. Sonnet xMac Studio enclosure with the Echo III expansion system Today we’re going to take a look at the xMac Studio Pro Rackmount System from Sonnet, with the Echo III expansion system, and even one of their m.2 8x4 silent gen4 PCIe cards to add some additional storage. We’re going through all of this today, including the rackmount case, the enclosure, testing different cards that work with a Mac, and even do some speed tests using the included PCIe NVMe card. This kind of expandability makes it hard to know why the Mac pro even exists. I tested lots of PCIe cards Why a Mac Studio over a Mac Mini? I bet you’re wondering, why a Mac Studio, and why not a Mac Mini? I debated this for quite some time and even started configuring a Mac Mini and after I started comparing the specs of what I wanted out of a Mac Mini m2 and a Mac Studio m2, I found that for only 100 dollars more I was able to get twice the GPU cores (38 in total), twice the RAM (64 in total), 2 additional USB C ports, a media card reader, faster on board SSDs and even faster memory. I did have to reduce the storage down to 1 TB but that’s a sacrifice I was willing to make and knew I could supplement storage with a system like this from Sonnet. Don’t get me wrong, the Mac Mini is a great Machine but once you start getting into the upper end of the specs, you’re better off going with a Mac Studio. Oh, also sonnet makes a Mac Mini rack too, which I’d love to test out in the future as a Mac build / render server. If you’re going to increase the specs of the Mac Mini, at some point you’re better off getting a Mac Studio Why Rack a Mac? The next question you’re probably asking is why rack a Mac system at all, I mean, aren’t they meant to be looked at? Joking. Kind of. I chose to rackmount my Mac Studio, not because it’s on brand (ding), but because I wanted better cable management. Wait, cable management? Yeah, cable management. Being a content creator, streamer, and developer, I have lots of cables and cords to connect lots of devices, like this 4kHDMI capture card that I connect cameras and devices to capture their output. The same goes for audio equipment, USB devices, XLR cables, and on and on. While building my server rack in my basement, I found that having everything in one cabinet, like a server rack, makes wire management much easier, or at least easier to hide. So recently I picked up a smaller server rack to rack both my Mac and my upcoming Windows / Linux build in a Sliger water cooled case. But there are many audio and video creative professionals who do rack their equipment and I am adapting it to fit my needs. Will it work? Let’s find out. xMac Studio Rack Case The xMac Studio rack mount case isn’t just a case to keep it safe, but a way to expand the capabilities of your Mac Studio. xMac Studio rakcmount case by Sonnet Features: 3u rackmount Rack mountable with rails (we’ll mount it later) Rugged Easy to access, front panel is removable Power button 4 USB-A 3.0 Hub PCIe expansion Module SSD Storage Space for up to 2 Thunderbolt or USB SSDs Great for extra storage or even time Machine backups on the go Front to back airflow so nothing is recirculated Echo III PCIe Enclosure The enclosure that comes with the xMac Studio / Echo III combo is actually a desktop enclosure that converts to a rack mount enclosure. It’s the same internals but without the outer case from the desktop module. This is a professional level enclosure for creative pros and can be connected to any device that has a Thunderbolt connection, but I opted for the rack mounted version without the desktop case. Let’s take a look at it. Echo III PCIe Enclosure Features: 3 PCIe Slots One is 16x and the other 2 are 8x These slots can be filled with any cards you can think of with the exception of video cards due to Apple’s limitation, but we’ll populate some here in a few, even a video card for fun All 3 are PCIe 3 Power supply is a 400w power supply easily power everything connected 75w auxiliary power connector for cards that require extra power Automatically power on and off based on your Machine’s power 2 Noctua fans that are temperature controlled and variable speed Thunderbolt 3 (which is better than Thunderbolt for for this use case. See Sonnet’s video explaining the differences) So what am I going to put in the slots? Well one of them for sure is the Sonnet M.2 8x4 silent Gen4 PCIe Card M.2 8x4 Silent Gen4 PCIe Card (NVMe SSD) This is the Sonnet M.2 8x4 Silent Gen4 PCIe Card and it’s a professional level card. That’s blazing fast! It’s a 16x card, and the bandwidth is available to all of the connected NVMe SSD which help facilitate maximum speeds. It works with Windows, Mac, or Linux computers that have an x16 slot and is compatible with a variety of m.2 NVMe Gen4 and Gen3 SSDs, but you’ll want Gen 4 if you’re going for speed. This card is blazing fast! Here’s the cool thing about this card too, is that it doesn’t require a specific motherboard for raid or any other features, and it does not require PCIe bifurcation. PCIe bifurcation is just a fancy word that means taking something and dividing it into parts. If the card didn’t support this, we would only see one device or need a special motherboard, but because this card does support bifurcation the card presents multiple devices to the computer so we can see each individual drive. That makes this card very flexible. I did install 8 NVMe SSDs into this card, installed the thermal transfer pad to transfer the heat from the ssd drives to the cooler. This helps keep the drive cool and avoid any kind of thermal throttling. Loaded it up with 8 NVMe drives! Features: Eight M.2 NVMe SSD Slots on a PCIe 4.0 x16 Card Works with Windows / Mac / Linux Up to 64 GB Silent, no fans Though the case does have super quiet noctua fans This Sonnet card doesn’t require a specific motherboard to operate or specific SSDs to support RAID features – no PCIe bifurcation required This allows me to connect 8 NVMe SSDs via Thunderbolt port using Echo III PCIe expansion enclosure which pops right into the xMac Studio. So let’s put all of this together, add some PCIe cards, and test various speeds and compatibility. Testing PCIe cards on a Mac First of all, it’s worth mentioning that this card is really intended for a high performance server or desktop that is connected to a PCIe 4.0 device and can take advantage of all 16 lanes of PCIe. This is not the case with my Mac Studio since it is limited by Thunderbolt and the enclosure only supports PCIe 3.0. This because Thunderbolt does not support PCIe 4.0. I know this all sounds complicated, because it is 😀. When testing in this enclosure over Thunderbolt, here are the speeds I was able to achieve: ~2800 MB/s Read / Write. This speed test maxed out Thunderbolt speeds! This is roughly 22 Gbs, which is no slouch, but that’s a far cry from the 40 Gbs that Thunderbolt supports? This is actually the theoretical max of Thunderbolt, it reserves half for downstream devices like monitors so that card, enclosure, and even Thunderbolt is performing as it should. This isn’t a limitation of the card or the enclosure, it’s a limitation of Thunderbolt. I will test this some more in my next rackmount project which is building my new Windows/Linux workstation in a Sliger case that’s water cooled. As a side note, I tested many other cards which aren’t covered here but can be seen in the video! More than a Rackmount for a Mac This speed test maxed out Thunderbolt speeds! Overall, I am very happy with my Sonnet xMac Studio and Echo III module. If you’re looking to rack your Mac Studio, there are few mounting options, but xMac Studio offers the additional Thunderbolt expansion system that really takes this to the next level. The combination of these two give me the flexibility I need to use my Mac how I want to use it. Thunderbolt connectivity ensures that I can connect this to any system I want, a new, a Windows Machine, or Linux, and even if they are a laptop. Overall it’s a great system even if Thunderbolt has some limitations. Well, I learned a lot about Thunderbolt 3 and 4, the Mac Studio, the xMac Studio system and I hope you learned something too. And remember if you found anything in this post helpful, don’t forget share! Thanks for reading! Join the conversation I found a way to rackmount a Mac, add PCIe devices, and even add 8 NVMe SSDs! Spoiler alert, I tested a GPU and it did not work.https://t.co/btbnQ5SlKw pic.twitter.com/9per30lu5a&mdash; Techno Tim (@TechnoTimLive) October 5, 2023 Links 🛍️ Check out the new Merch Shop at https://l.technotim.com/shop ⚙️ See all the hardware I recommend at https://l.technotim.com/gear 🚀 Don’t forget to check out the 🚀Launchpad repo with all of the quick start source files" }, { "title": "Turn Plex into a Powerful DVR", "url": "/posts/ota-tv-with-plex/", "categories": "homelab", "tags": "plex, tv, ota, epg, dvr", "date": "2023-09-18 08:00:00 -0500", "content": "Cut the cord and get free over the air TV with Plex! Today we’ll dive deep into selecting a TV tuner, an antenna, dialing in your TV signal, and configuring Plex to help you get the most out of Live TV and DVR! A huge THANK YOU to Plex for sponsoring this video during Plex Pro Week! Get started with Plex today! https://www.plex.tv/ 📺 Watch Video Turn Plex into a Powerful DVR There’s this great free resource out there that many people aren’t taking advantage of. It’s something that most homes can access absolutely free and that’s over the air TV. Now I know what you’re thinking, what year is this?? I know, it sounds odd talking about over the air TV in this day and age but I found a way to modernize it and make it more accessible with a little bit of hardware and a little bit of software from Plex. I have been using Plex for almost 10 years and one of the features that isn’t talked about that much and is one of my favorites is Live TV &amp; DVR. I’m not talking about the free TV channels that Plex offers, although I will be talking about that a little bit later, I am talking about over the air channels like ABC, NBC, PBS, and many others to watch Sports, Local News, and more. And with ATSC 3.0 or NextGen TV rolling out in some areas, you can be sure that you’re getting the clearest broadcast possible with up to 4k resolution and uncompressed when over the air vs. 1080p and compressed from most providers. You’ll need a few simple things that I will cover in this video so you can start watching and recording Live TV today. So, full disclosure Plex is the sponsor of the original video and I want to thank them for asking me to share my deep dive on Live TV &amp; DVR with Plex. Plex can be a powerful DVR to record or watch your favorite TV shows Plex TV &amp; DVR With a TV Tuner, an antenna, and a Plex Pass you can turn your media server into a powerful DVR to record your favorite shows or watch them live, even on the go. You can record any show in your area, whether that be sports, local news, or your favorite TV series and watch it from any device. Plex has apps for mobile devices, SmartTVs, gaming consoles, Apple TV, on the web and more. It’s hard to find a device that doesn’t have Plex. Watching Live TV is as simple as launching the app and picking a channel. This will stream the channel from your Plex Media Server to your device. After the Live TV stream starts, you can pause or even rewind Live TV. But if you start watching something that’s currently being recorded, you have the option to watch from the beginning or watch live. If you choose to watch from the start you can skip through commercials and get caught up to the live broadcast. This is a little life hack I use to watch something that’s live without the commercials. For something you’ve already recorded, there’s also this awesome feature that will allow you to skip commercials or remove them altogether. This is a great time saver and we’ll get this set up today too a little bit later. One of the best parts of Plex Live TV is you get the best EPG out there. EPG stands for electronic programming guide and it lists all shows for all channels along with some additional data like episode information and more. It’s how I know that Jeopardy! is on NBC at 4:30 local time, or that the episode of Nature is a rerun. It’s also what helps populate their powerful search in the Live TV section. I can’t stress enough how important it is to have a solid EPG when using a DVR, without accurate data you could schedule the wrong show to record or miss your show altogether. The EPG is even interactive on some clients, giving you a picture-in-picture guide while you browse the guide looking for the next thing to watch. And if you only watch a handful of local channels you can add channels to your favorites so you can quickly access them. Plex Live TV lets you prioritize your recordings so that I don’t get in trouble recording a rerun of Nature instead of the latest episode of The Bachelor. We’ll talk more about the EPG, recording priority, how not to miss your favorite shows when scheduling recordings a little bit later. Plex’s EPG is the best Electronic Programming Guide out there! Setting Up Live TV &amp; DVR So, what do we need in order to have our very own DVR? I know all of this sounds complicated but it’s much easier than you think. You’ll need a couple of things, all of which I use in my own home and have been recording TV for years, so you can be sure that this setup will also work for you. TV Tuners First, you’re going to need a Plex server and a Plex pass. Next you’ll need a TV Tuner and an antenna. I’ve used a lot of TV Tuners in the past but the best tuner by far is one from SiliconDust, it’s the HDHomeRun Flex 4k. This nice little device sits on your network and converts a TV signal into a video stream so that your Plex Media Server can consume it and even change the channels when requested. This one in particular has 4 tuners inside that allows you to watch or record up to 4 channels at once. This one also supports the new ATSC 3.0 NextGen TV that we talked about earlier - so it’s future proof! Silicon Dust’s HDHomerun TV Tuner will get you up and running in no time! Antennas Another important thing you’ll want to have is an antenna that connects to our tuner. Antennas come in all shapes and sizes and depending on where you live, you might be able to get by with a small indoor antenna. If you’re in the US, there’s a great site to help you determine your distance from TV towers which might help you choose the right antenna. You can visit the site, enter your location, and see how far away you are from TV towers, their location, and get an estimate of the signal strength to your location. Based on this legend you can make a better decision about the antenna you choose. Selecting an antenna is key to getting the right reception! Here are my recommendation for choosing an antenna: If you’re close to the TV towers and want something low profile, or you live in an apartment or condo and can’t put an antenna outside, go with a flat antenna which is thin, low profile, and can be placed in a window or on the wall. This flat antenna from Channel Master (affiliate link) should work great if most TV towers are in the green or yellow. It’s slim, low profile, and can be attached to a window or wall. If you’re further away from the TV tower or you just want the best reception, I recommend picking up something like this Antennas Direct antenna (affiliate link) that can be used indoors or outdoors. It’s not the best looking antenna but it has a great range and will work better than the flat antenna if you can hide it or aren’t concerned about aesthetics. Either way, you’ll want to mount it somewhere in your home, the higher the better, outdoors or an attic will work best. I got lucky when I moved into my house because the previous owner installed a massive long range antenna in the attic and ran a coax cable to the basement. Having one in the attic above the trees and other houses is one of the best places for an antenna. Hooking Up Your Antenna &amp; Tuner Once you have your antenna and tuner, go ahead and connect your tuner to the network and connect your antenna to the coaxial terminal and then finally, connect the power to the tuner. A word of caution, you might be tempted to buy an amplifier but I would recommend against it until you truly know that you have a weak signal, you run the risk of introducing noise and interference. We’ll see this later on and from there you can determine if you need a signal amplifier (affiliate link) or not. Once your tuner is on the network, visit tuner’s web page by typing in the IP address in a browser. Here you will see the landing page for your device. If you see a message to update your firmware I would update it before continuing, it will only take a minute, plus, who doesn’t love updating firmware 😀 Once it’s updated you can see the tuner status and more information about your tuner. Next we want to see which channels our tuner can detect. We can do this by going into the channel lineup and clicking “Detect Channels”. This will scan for all of the channels you can pick up using your antenna. Now your mileage may vary depending on your area and how close you are to the TV towers, but it’s a good idea to compare the results to what you expect. If you aren’t seeing the channels you expect, you might need to adjust your antenna or think about getting a signal amplifier, however I’ll show you how to check the signal strength in a little bit. One thing you might have noticed is that little plug that I have connected to my HDHomeRun. This is a signal filter (affiliate link) that will filter out LTE and 5G signals from the line. I’ve noticed that as more cell phone towers go up, the more they can interfere with my antenna, so I popped this little filter on to filter out those frequencies. If you’re wondering what interference looks like, it’s that weird pixelated blocking that you see sometimes when watching TV. This isn’t going to magically make channels appear out of nowhere or boost the signal, it’s just there to take away the noise created by cell phone towers. Once we’ve got our tuner all set up, make note of the IP address because we’ll need this for configuring Plex. You might need to pick up an LTE filter to filter out 5G noise! Setting up Plex for Live TV Now that we have our TV Tuner and antenna set up, we can now configure this in Plex! You’ll need to sign in to your Plex Media Server and then go to settings. In the Manage section you should see Live TV &amp; DVR. Here you’ll want to configure a new tuner. When you try to add a new tuner, it will try to search for your tuner and in most cases it will find your device. If it doesn’t you can manually add your device by typing in the IP address of our tuner. Once it’s added you’ll need to set a few settings for Plex. You should choose an antenna, your home country, and your Postal Code. The postal code is needed to download the EPG. Once you’ve set this, you will then see a list of all the channels we found earlier. You can scan again or even remove channels however I wouldn’t remove channels here, I would just create favorites later. If you’re happy with the list, click continue. Plex will start to download the latest guide and after a few minutes we should see all of the TV shows that are available! Recording Live TV The channel guide can be found in the Live TV section. Here we can see a list of all of the shows we can watch or record. This will look different on different clients but the experience is mostly the same. The live TV feature is pretty self explanatory, we can scroll through channels and when we see something we want to watch, we just click on it. This will start a live stream. You can even pause or rewind a Live TV show, pretty cool. So you can see that I have a pretty good signal and quality but what do you do if you don’t have the greatest picture quality? Well, earlier I mentioned that we could check our signal strength for a broadcast to determine if we need to adjust our antenna or think about a signal booster. This might work differently depending on your tuner, but if you’re using a SiliconDust tuner like the one I am using, the easiest way I have found to do this is to start a live show and then go to your tuner’s homepage while the show is playing. Once here go into Tuner Status and choose the tuner that’s being used, which you can see in the Summary. Click on the tuner that is in use and here you can see the status. The most important stat here is Signal Quality. The higher the better. If you notice that this is noticeably low and your TV stream isn’t the greatest you can try adding a signal booster or a line filter to try and clean it up. I will have links to this and all of the other hardware we talked about today in the video description. So, back to recording from the channel guide… After selecting a show, if you want to record a show all you have to do is click the record button. From here you can choose whether you want to record new airings only, new and repeat, and which library you want to save it to. I have multiple libraries, TV Shows and Recorded TV. That’s because I wanted to separate the two but that’s totally up to you. It’s as simple as creating a new library and setting the type to TV Shows. You will then see this option when scheduling recordings. Scheduling to shows to record couldn’t be easier with their great EPG! You also have some additional settings in “Show Advanced” but we won’t change them here, we’ll apply these to all recorded TV a little bit later. After clicking record we can now see that we have a record icon on the show, letting us know that it’s currently being recorded. You also have lots of quick actions when hovering or clicking on shows where you can schedule recordings or even cancel recordings, it’s pretty handy. One thing you might have noticed is the categories across the top. Most of these are self-explanatory, however there’s one named Plex Channels that is different from the rest of the TV channels. These are FAST channels or Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television. It’s streaming TV that can be watched at any time. They aren’t channels that you can find over the air from your local TV stations, but channels that stream content 24/7, like for instance if you wanted to binge watch Top Gear or the Price is Right classics, there’s a channel for that. But, back to recorded TV. Watching Recorded TV Once a show has recorded it will be in your Library you set for recorded TV, the default is TV Shows. Once here you’ll see a similar experience that we see for Movies, you’ll have a “Recommended” section, a “Library” section, and a “Category” section, and view controls for your media. Clicking on your show will bring you to that show and from there you can see all of the recorded seasons for that show and if you want to get to your show you click into the season to get to your episodes. Once you are on your episode you can see more details about it like the date it aired, how long the recording is, the rating, and even details about this episode. You can also switch the track to another language and choose your subtitles if the broadcast supports it. After clicking play the video will start and you can watch it as you normally would! Watching recorded TV is just like watching other media, complete with all of the artwork and metadata you’re use to seeing with other content! AutoSkip Intro, Commercials, Credits One of the best features that comes with Live TV &amp; DVR is Intro Skip and Commercial Skip. If enabled Plex can detect intros, commercials, and even credits to help you watch more TV without interruptions. When playing a show where an intro is detected, you will see a skip intro button in the bottom right corner that you can click on and it will skip right to the show. This also works for commercials too! When a commercial break starts you will see a button to skip Ads which will skip right to where the show picks back up! Now it’s not perfect but I’d say it’s pretty close for the shows that I watch. It’s not enabled by default so let’s enable it! We can do this in our library settings which you can find in the Manage section. If we edit our Recorded TV library and go to “Advanced“ we should see a few settings in here that help us skip unwanted content. Be sure that “Enable Intro detection” and “Enable Credits detection” is turned on and then for the “Ads detection” setting you’ll want to choose “For recorded items” . This enables ad detection for new recordings. If you’ve already recorded TV with Plex or from another TV you can turn on “For all items” to force a scan of all items in this folder. Great, once that’s turned on it should now add these markers so we can skip unwanted content. This detection does take a few minutes and only starts after a show is done recording. Also, you won’t see new recordings in your Library until it is done doing the detection. Now we can skip all of that unwanted content and watch TV like a pro. Like this show right here, if we start playing you can see it detects the intro that we can skip through if we like, and then once we get to a commercial break it will prompt us to skip it we like, and if it detects credits it will do the same. Skipping commercials, intros, and credits makes watching OTA a breeze. No more wasting time! DVR Settings Now there are some additional settings you can choose for skipping commercials like removing them altogether. This is in the DVR settings where we can set our default settings for new recordings. In the “Detect Commercials” setting you can choose from “Disabled”, “Detect”, “Mark for Skip”, or “Delete”. “I would recommend setting this to “Detect and Mark for skip” rather than setting it to “Detect and Delete” because deleting is a destructive action and while Plex commercial skip is really good at detecting commercials, it’s a lot safer to just add markers than accidentally delete part of your show. As for the rest of the settings in here, I have only adjusted a few. I set the resolution to Prefer HD. I don’t replace lower resolution items, I do allow partial airings, and I don’t adjust the minutes before and after a recording. Shows are pretty good at starting and ending on time, but if you find that you want to record a minute or two before and after, adjust the setting here. Live broadcasts that go over the scheduled time like sports might be a good good reason to add some padding at the end of the recording so you don’t miss overtime! Also I enable a refresh of the guide data during the maintenance window and for me that’s 2am. Adjusting Recording Priority So now that we have scheduled some recordings, how do we make sure that my reruns of Nature and NOVA don’t get scheduled instead of my wife’s show The Bachelor? (You’ll only make that mistake once). We can do this easily by adjusting our recording priority. If we go back into the Live TV area and choose the DVR Schedule we can see everything that’s scheduled to record and on the far right we can see our Recording Priority. This is where we can drag and drop to reorder our shows with the highest priority being at the top. This helps when there are scheduling conflicts due to the tuners being in use when recording or watching live TV. I have 4 tuners so I rarely have a conflict but if I did this is how it will choose to prioritize one recording over the other. Let’s say for instance I wanted to get in trouble again and prioritize Nature over The Bachelor, Survivor, and even Big Brother, I would just drag Nature all above all of those shows like. This would ensure that if there was ever a conflict or not enough free tuners, Nature would record instead of all of these shows. OK, let’s move this back before I get in trouble again. Be sure to adjust your recording priority so that you can be sure your tops shows record over others if you run out of tuners! Channel Favorites Now that we have everything set, there’s also this small feature to make your life a little easier when channel surfing and that’s Favorites. As you can see from my list of local channels, I have a lot of channels that I almost never watch but at the same time I don’t want to remove them from my channel lined up. This is where favorites come in. I like to add all of my favorite channels to my favorites list so that I can easily browse them when I am looking for something to watch. You can even add some of the Plex FAST channels to your favorites too! I really like the BBC Earth channel, PBS Nature, and the Modern Marvels channel and I have added those to my favorites too. They have over 600 to choose from, so there’s no shortage of content there. Now, if I switch and go to my favorites, I can see a quick list of my favorite channels without skipping around through all of the channels I rarely watch. Mobile Now just because I did all of this from a browser doesn’t mean you have to do it here too. Plex’s mobile app works great for watching live TV, previously recorded TV, and even scheduling recordings. There have been many times where my wife and I are out and about and hear about a new show that’s airing soon and it’s now second nature to immediately schedule it to record. I just open up the app, go to Live TV, Search for the show, and schedule the recording. It’s super simple and convenient to do. The mobile app is not only great for watching shows, but also scheduling a recording while you are on the go! Conclusion So that’s everything you need to get started today to record live TV like a pro. I’ve been using this setup with Plex for years and it’s everything I could want in a DVR system, from high quality over the air uncompressed video and audio, to an accurate EPG, to how easy it is to schedule recordings anywhere on any device, to commercial skipping and so much more. I want to thank Plex again for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching. Well, I learned a ton about live TV, antennas, network tuners, and Plex, and I hope you learned something too.

If you want to see the video of this tour, you can check it out here! The Tour We got a tour of the labs where they are cooking up some new storage systems Day 1 started out with a tour of the 45Drives HQ. The office is new, fully of natural light, and very modern. One of the last stops was to visit the labs area where they were testing hardware, cluster configurations, and even had some prototype devices. A Storinator that includes both 2.5” drives and 3.5” drives Storage Solutions The first stop was the Storiantor Hybrid F8 x1. This is an interesting configuration because it combines both 3.5” slots of high density drives and 2.5” slots for SSDs. THis something I have been particularly interested in because I’ve modified my Storinator to do just that. This one solution would allow me to keep my workloads that need fast storage, like virtual machines, on up to 8 SSDs, while still giving me 12 bays for HDDs that could store all of my “slow” data like videos, images, and documents. All flash Storinator! The next stop was the Stornado Gen II 2U SATA. This machine is specifically designed for speed and offers 32 slots for all flash storage. This is also something that I am interested in, not only because it would allow me to move to an all flash solution, but also because it comes in a 2U factor and would help reduce energy costs. THis does mean however that I will have to spend more on SSDs so not sure if there’s a real cost benefit for my specific application. (Still want all flash storage though! 😂) The Storinator Homelab H15 (prototype) The next stop was one of the most anticipated devices for me (being part of the HomeLab community) that was the 45 Homelab HL15. This device is meant to meet the needs of Homelab enthusiasts. This machine has the same build quality you would expect from a 45Drives system and has very similar parts and storage as their enterprise versions. One of the cool things about this version is that it can be rack mounted or stand alone as a desktop. One thing you’ll notice too is that it uses a standard ATX power supply which is a welcome addition for something that will be primarily used by consumers which will allow them to use commodity hardware. 45Drives have said that they will sell this devices in a few configurations, per their website: The current server under development is a 15-bay, 4U chassis that will be offered in three options: Fully built system – including CPU, RAM, etc. Chassis with backplanes and PSU Chassis with only backplanes If you’re interested I would highly recommend signing up for their newsletter The Storinator Jr., a Raspberry Pi based storage server (prototype) The next stop was the Storinator Jr. This device is only a prototype but was inspired by Jeff Geerling’s Petabyte Pi project. The idea is simple, create a “mini” Storinator that is backed by a Raspberry Pi, but the technical limitations of the Pu were almost insurmountable. You’ll have to check out Jeff’s video for all of the challenges he had to overcome. To be clear, this was only a R&amp;D Project and this product may never come to market, cool nonetheless. Mitch Hall discussing Ceph at 45 Drives_ Creator Led Discussions With the tour out of the way it was time to hop into our tech discussions. 45Drives kicked it off with talks from their CO-founder, architects, sales, and more. The topics ranged from the history of 45Drives, Ceph Clustering and “Cluster for Everyone”, to even ransomware protection using Snapshield which can quickly terminate connections from a suspected infected device. Me (Timothy Stewart) discussing 45Drives at Home(Lab) After that, it was my turn. For context, all creators were asked to share a topic related to storage, and I felt the most valuable thing I could talk about was my experience with a 45Drives Storinator at home. Also, in case you didn’t know, all current Storinators target enterprise customers and so I thought it was a rare opportunity to give them feedback about using and converting one of their storage servers for home use. This might be something that they would incorporate into their Homelab product. And yes, I did throw in the RGB idea. We’ll see how that goes… Jeff Geerling discussing the history of 45Drives &amp; Content Creators Up next was a discussion led by Jeff Geerling. This was an interesting talk about the history of 45Drives involvement with content creators raging from Linus, to MKBHD, to iJustine, and even their recent round of creators (all of us). Jeff also analyzed each of the videos and broke them down into why they were successful vs ones that weren’t particularly successful (from a YouTube views perspective). He talked about his process, script writing, and even storytelling and offered some feedback on how they could improve their reach on their own content if they focused more on story storytelling with a hook. This is something that I definitely need to work on too, so I will be trying to apply this more to my future content. Alan Nagl giving a deep dive on hard drive technology Next was Alan Nagl from HDStor who did a deep dive on hard drives, how they work, and how the “SSD will never replace the HDD”. I learned quite a bit about about hard drives, how they work, HAMR hard drives and as a bonus learned all about helium filled drives at dinner. Alan is a wealth of information when it comes to storage! Tom Lawrence discussing ZFS and Ceph solutions Last but not least was Tom Lawrence from Lawrence systems. He joined virtual because he couldn’t attend in person but his topic was a discussion on how to position clustering in the market vs single server solutions. Tom had a lot of the same questions I had about Ceph, when to use Ceph, and at what point does Ceph make sense over a large ZFS pool. Outside of lunch, dinner, and lots of snacks, that pretty much summed up the day. Lots of great talked and more to come tomorrow! Join the conversation If you&#39;re curios what we&#39;ve been up to here at at 45 Drives here&#39;s my recap of Day 1https://t.co/qWvzC4XdHd&mdash; Techno Tim (@TechnoTimLive) August 25, 2023 Links 🛍️ Check out the new Merch Shop at https://l.technotim.com/shop ⚙️ See all the hardware I recommend at https://l.technotim.com/gear 🚀 Don’t forget to check out the 🚀Launchpad repo with all of the quick start source files" }, { "title": "Use Windows like a Pro! - PowerToys Tutorial", "url": "/posts/windows-powertoys/", "categories": "utilities", "tags": "windows, powertoys, productivity, microsoft, open-source", "date": "2023-08-20 08:00:00 -0500", "content": "Today we’re going to maximize your Productivity on Windows with Microsoft PowerToys. I’ll show you step-by-step how you can use, customize, and be more efficient when using Microsoft PowerToys. 📺 Watch Video What are PowerToys for Windows? PowerToys is a set of utilities and apps that help you enhance the functionality of Windows and maximize your productivity. These tools provide a range of features, shortcuts, enhancements, and various ways to make you more efficient when using Windows. It also has some features that you might have seen in other operating systems but can be enabled in Windows too with PowerToys. If you haven’t heard of PowerToys or it’s been a while since you’ve looked at all the features, sit back as we go through every utility in the PowerToys suite and by the end of this video you’ll be be a pro, or at least you’ll look like one while using Windows. PowerToys is open source and is being rapidly developed and they are adding new features with almost every release. So hopefully byu the end of this video I will have convinced you to install PowerToys and hit the like and subscribe button. Once installed you’ll have a little icon in your system tray where you can launch individual applications, toggle features on and off, or see all settings for all applications. To get started, download and install PowerToys. Always On Top Keep a windows on top with Always On Top We’ll start with Always on Top. This allows you to pin windows on top of all of your other windows. This is helpful for those times when you want a window to always hover above all other windows, regardless of which window is in focus. To activate it you press: ⊞ Win+Ctrl+T This will play a sound and show a border around the window that will always be on top. Now if you try to drag a window on top of this window it will remain on top. You can adjust the color mode for the border and choose any color you like or just stick with your theme’s default. You can also adjust the thickness of the border and choose whether or not you want to round the corners. Finally, you can also choose to enable or disable the sound when activating. You can also choose to exclude apps from pinning on top by entering the process name here. After adding it here, this process will ignore the shortcut to activate Always on Top. Awake Keep your computer awake without adjusting your power settings! Awake is a quick way to keep your computer away without having to adjust any of your power &amp; sleep settings. This is helpful when running demos, conferences, or any other task where you want to be sure that your device doesn’t go to sleep or turn off its screen. In the settings for this utility you can choose to keep using the selected power plan, which means it will not affect your power settings at all. If you change it Keep away indefinitely, your computer will stay awake until you explicitly put the machine to sleep or your exit or disable the utility. This also activates the Keep screen on setting, which gives you the option to also keep your screen on too. If you choose to keep away for a time interval you can choose how long you want the utility to stay in this mode before reverting back to the previous state. Once the timer is up, it will revert back to the default setting. The last setting, keep awake until expiration allows you to choose a date and time to end awake mode. This is Like the previous setting, after this expires, it will revert back to your previous setting. This is handy if you have a specific date and time you want to end awake mode. Color Picker Pick a color from any running application using Color Picker! Next up is Color Picker and this is one of my favorite utilities in Power Toys. It lets you choose a color from any currently running application and you can copy it in a configurable format to your clipboard. Unlike color pickers for browsers, this works system wide and is great for creatives and developers. To activate the Color Picker press: ⊞ Win+Shift+C This will activate the color picker window where you can drag your cursor to any item on the screen. You will see a color preview and the color value in a specific format that we can change. To sample the color, just click and it’s on your clipboard ready for you to paste. We have lots of nice options we can change in the settings for this utility, for example, we can choose what happens when we activate the color picker, we can choose to open the editor, pick a color and open the editor, or only pick a color. I set mine to pick a color and open editor because this gives me a popup after choosing my color where I can choose the one of the supported color formats to choose from. I can copy the value to my clipboard to use it. It also has a history feature on the left where I can choose previously sampled colors which is nice if you use this tool often. If you want to fine tune the color you picked, the editor will also show 2 shades darker and 2 shades lighter in the editor window at the top. If you want to go back to the previously selected color it will be in your history. Also, you can choose to customize the color even more by clicking on the color at the top middle and making adjustments using the slider. You can also choose the default color formats to choose from and even add your own if you don’t see one of the 3 that come out of the box. I typically only use HEX and RGB in my day tyo day but it’s nice to know you have the option to add more. Another thing I usually turn on is showing the color name. This is handy if you aren’t great at color recognition and need a way to describe this color to someone else. Just toggle it on, activate the color picker and you will see the name of the color that it matches. FancyZones Customize your windows layout using FancyZones! The Windows manager in Windows is ok and is improved in later versions of Windows but FancyZones take this to the next level. FancyZones is a windows manager utility for arranging and snapping windows into custom layouts to help you work the way you want to with your windows and allows you to quickly restore them too. This is one of the most feature rich utilities in the stack so I’ll try to break down the most important parts to get you going fast. If you’re going to FancyZones I would recommend letting FancyZones override the default Windows Snap that’s built in. You can do this in the settings and toggling on the override settings Next let’s choose a default layout for our zones. You can activate this by pressing: ⊞ Win+Shift+` Here you can choose one of the existing templates or create your own. Let’s choose one of the existing ones for now. After choosing a template you can now drag a window while holding Shift and you will see your zones appear. As you move the window around you will see zones you can snap this window too. If you want to snap zone 3, just drop it in zone 3 and it will fill this area. You can repeat this for any window you have open. If you want to do this without using the mouse, you can press: ⊞ Win+left/right For example if you want to move a window into one of the zones, while the window is in focus press ⊞ Win + right multiple times to cycle through the zones. Once you find the zone you want, just let go of the ⊞ Win key and you’re done! Once you start snapping windows in the same zone, you might find that you want to switch between windows that are snapped to the same zone, you can easily do this by selecting a window in that zone and then pressing ⊞ Win+PgUp/PgDn. This will cycle through all windows snapped to this zone. If you want to customize a zone template you can do so by pressing ⊞ Win+Shift+` and then editing your template and adjusting some of the options. You can increase the number of zones, increase the space around zones, and even the distance to highlight adjacent zones which is helpful when trying to merge 2 zones together when dragging a window around. If you’re not happy with existing zone templates you can create your own by using the Zone Editor If you activate the Zone picker with: ⊞ Win+Shift+` You will see this button at the bottom that says create new layout. If you click, you can create your own custom zones in either a grid layout that snaps windows into place without overlapping, or canvas which is kind of free form and will allow you to overlap windows. Now there are many more customization options in the settings like changed colors, multi monitor support File Locksmith Unlock those pesky locked files using File Locksmith! File Locksmith is a nice little utility to help you know which files are in use and by which process. This is really helpful if you are trying to figure out which application is locking a file. For example if I right click on this folder and select “What’s using this file?” it will check to see if any of the files in this folder are being used. We can see here that I have a document opened with Word, Excel, VSCode, and even explorer. I can expand the details of each and see what the specific files are. I can even end the task from here, killing the process and removing the lock. Just be careful if you end the task, it will kill all instances of it. File Explorer Add-ons Make Windows Explorer more useful with these add-ons! This File Explorer add-on utility adds some additional functionality to Windows Explorer. The first setting allows you to preview additional file types in the preview pane on the right. To toggle on the preview pane you can press Alt + P. With this setting toggled on you can now see previews for SVGs, Markdown, Source code files, PDFs, and gcode files. The other setting with this the File Explorer add-on utility allows you to see more thumbnails inside of explorer when browsing your file system. This can be handy if you work with these types of files, letting you easily see a preview of the file before opening. Host File Editor Never make a mistake again editing your host file with Host File Editor! The Host File Editor utility allows you to quickly make changes to your host file. Your host file is the first place Windows looks to resolve IP addresses and although not common unless you are in IT, you might have some non standard items in this list. The host file editor makes it easy to edit this file without making mistakes. You’ll want to be sure that most of the settings are at default in order to get the most out of this utility and that’s “launch as administrator”, “show a warning at startup”, “top being the position of additional content”, and the encoding being “UTF-8”. You can then launch the host file editor and quickly add additional host entries without having to edit them manually. You can add comments, toggle them on and off, reorder entries moving them up and down, run a test ping, and even see the original host file by clicking on this button. Image Resizer Bulk resize images with Image Resizer! Another great feature of Power Toys is the image resizer. The image resizer lets you bulk resize images just by right clicking and then choosing “Resize pictures” This will pop up some options where you can choose the output for the resize. There are some presets that you can adjust in the settings but the default options are best. After choosing your size and clicking resize, Windows will batch convert all of them files for you. By default it will make copies so it’s safe to run, but this can be changed easily when resizing your files. There are also more settings you can choose from in the image Resizer settings. Still waiting on that webp option. Keyboard Manager Take control of your keyboard mapping using Keyboard Manager! The Keyboard Manage is a nice little utility that allows you to remap your keys on your keyboard. This is handy if you have an odd keyboard or want to customize some unused keys. For example if we want to remap a keep that is rarely used, at least form, like the CapsLock key, we can easily do that by opening the utility and then either selecting or pressing our physical key of CapsLock and then selecting or typing the key you want to map it to. I chose to enter. When saving you will see a warning about CapsLock no longer being mapped but that’s ok since I never use it. You’re free to remap this if you like. After saving this, you can now see that my CapsLock key is working just like my Enter key! Well, looks like I can’t yell at anyone on the internet anymore, so let’s un do that. JK You can also remap shortcuts if you like. If we wanted to remap the control + c shortcut to control +v in chrome only, we can do it like this. This will now override the copy function with the paste function only when in chrome. Confusing, but it works great. Mouse Utilities Get some help for your cursor with Mouse Utilities! Mouse Utilities is another one of my favorite Power Toys in this suite. It is a collection of features that enhance the mouse and cursor functions on Windows. It has 4 different features, the first being FInd my Mouse. Find My Mouse highlights the position of the cursor when you press the left Control key twice. This is helpful if you can’t find your mouse or even when giving demos to emphasize an area in your demonstration. I use this quite a bit to help viewers focus on what I am focusing on. You can change many aspects of this spotlight and animation, making it just the way you like. You can even change the activation method so if you don’t like pressing left control twice, you can just shake your mouse until it activates. The next is Mouse Highlighter, this will highlight left and right clicks of your mouse. You can activate it by pressing ⊞ Win+Shift+H. Once activated left clicks will be the default color of yellow and right clicks will be the default color of blue. If you want a different color or experience all of these can be adjusted in the settings. The next is Mouse Jump. You can activate it with ⊞ Win+Shift+D and then it will show you a screenshot of your desktop. If you click on an area in the image, it will jump your cursor to the location that was clicked. This is great for large monitors where you need to travel great distances. Maybe one day I will have a monitor with a resolution this high to where I need something like this. The last one in Mouse Utilities is Mouse Pointer Crosshairs. If you activate this with ⊞ Win+Alt+P it will draw crosshairs centered on your mouse pointer. You can adjust any of the settings for the crosshairs in the Appearance &amp; Behavior section. Mouse Without Borders Remote control up to 4 machines using one mouse and keyboard with Mouse Without Borders! This is by far one of the coolest features of Power Toys and probably the most complicated. Mouse Without Borders allows you to control up to 4 computers from the same machine with only one keyboard and mouse. Think of it like extending your desktop across multiple machines but you can remote control all machines from all machines. This will make more sense in a bit. You’ll need at least one additional machine with Power Toys installed. Once you have Power Toys installed on all machines, be sure that Enable Mouse Without Borders is turned on. On the first computer, select New Key to generate a new security key so you can securely connect. Then on the second machine enter the Security Key that was generated on the first machine and enter the first machine’s name. Then select connect. You will then see both machines appear in the device layout. You can rearrange them here to match their physical layout. Now you can switch between each computer by just moving your mouse cursor to the edge of the screen and it will transition between computers! You can add additional computers by repeating this process! Another cool thing I learned is that you can also go the other way too and control your primary machine from the secondary, just start moving the mouse over the shared edge and it will jump back to your main machine! There are lots of settings and features that you can play with, but some worth mentioning are: sharing the clipboard between machines. This is allows you to copy text from one machine and paste it into another and Copying files between machines. Files less than 100 MB can be transferred too! This is as simple as copying a file and then pasting it. You will see the file transferred using the clipboard. Pretty cool! If you ever want to disconnect from other remote machines, you can simply generate a new key and the others will drop. There are additional settings, keyboard shortcuts, and even a troubleshooting section that I encourage you to explore once you’ve set this up. Paste As Plain Text Remove all formatting when copying and pasting text with Paste As Plain Text! Paste as plain text is just what it sounds like, it will paste text as plain text without the additional formatting. This is super helpful when you are copying something from the web and pasting it into a document. To fix this all you need to do is enable Paste as Plain Text in Power Toys and then when pasting just ⊞ Win+Ctrl+Alt+V and it will paste your text without the formatting. Peek Get a quick preview of your files without switching context with Peek! Peek is a nice little utility that lets you preview a file without opening it up and without scaling up explorer. To use Peek, be sure it’s turned on and then select a file in explorer and press Ctrl+Space. THis will bring up a preview window where you can check out the file and even arrow through files if you have multiple. Then to close just press the same keys Ctrl+Space and it will close the preview. PowerRename Rename multiple files like a pro with PowerRename! PowerRename is another one of my top used Power Toys. It’s a bulk renaming tool that has a ton of flexibility for managing file names in bulk. To use it, be sure it’s enabled and then select a group of files you want to rename and right click. From there you will see the PowerRename option. After clicking it you will see a new interface that will help you rename files along with a preview. You search within a file name for specific text and even use regex if you like. You can then add text to replace the found text. You can apply it to extensions, files, folders, and sub folders. You can also shift the case to lower, upper, title case, or capitalize each word. You can even enumerate each item, basically giving them a numeric suffix. One other cool thing you can do is use variables in the file name. You can see a list of variables by licking the info button. From here you can click variables and it will add them to the text to replace. Once you are satisfied with the text, you can apply it and it will batch rename all of your files! PowerToys Run Quickly launch applications, do calculations, and more using the missing app launcher for Windows, Run! PowerToys Run is one of those features that once you start using it’s hard to go back to the old way of doing things. It saves so much time and you look cool doing it too. PowerToys run is a quick launch utility that when pressed will allow you to launch applications, do calculations, even search the web just by typing and it’s way faster than the start menu. To launch PowerTypes Run press: Alt+Space From here you can do simple things like launch applications. If you want to launch Chrome just type “chrome” then hit enter. Easy enough. You can also search for files, settings, and even the web. You can also do some advanced searches using plugins. For example if you want to do calculations, you just type in the expression and it will compute it and if you want to copy the value to your clipboard you just hit enter. If you want to base64 encode something you can just type #base64 abcdef and see the value and hit enter to copy it to your clipboard. If you want a guid, just type #guid and it will generate one for you. There are lots of plugins you can explore in the settings or toggle off if you don’t plan on using them. Definitely worth checking out all of the available settings you can change if you’re going to use this feature. Super powerful, super cool. Quick Accent Never misspell jalapeños again with Quick Accent! Quick Accent is a quick way to type accented characters, this is especially useful when using a keyboard layout that doesn’t support the specific accent. For example on a US English keyboard layout there isn’t an easy to type “ñ”. This makes it hard to type jalapeños. But don’t worry, with the Quick Accent power toy it’s super easy to do. After enabling Quick Accent you can activate it by pressing the key you want to accent along with space. Here we’ll hold N while pressing space. Then you can keep pressing the spacebar to cycle through the different characters. Once you find the one you want, just let go of the N and it will insert it. If you want to insert “ö” in German, you hold O, and tap spacebar until you find it, then let go of O. There are many settings you can change, especially the activation key if you want to switch from using the spacebar. Registry Preview Get a visual preview of Registry files using Registry Preview! Registry preview is a quick little utility to visually preview registry changes. If you’ve ever opened a registry file with a text editor, you know the struggle of trying to validate these files, especially when editing. Registry Preview makes that a little easier. After opening Registry Preview you’ll then want to select a registry file to open. On the right you can see a preview of where this key lives in your registry along with any of the values. If you want to edit this file, you can on the right. Once edited you can save the file and then reload the file and you can then see the changes in the preview window. If you’re satisfied with these changes you can write them to the registry. You can also use the “Open Key” button to open the registry editor directly to your key. A word of caution, only edit the registry if you know what you’re doing. Screen Ruler Measure pixels anywhere with Screen Ruler! Screen Ruler is a PowerToy that’s not only helpful if you’re a designer or developer, but it’s also super fun to use! Screen ruler helps you measure the pixels on your screen based on image edge detection. You can activate it with ⊞ Win+Shift+M and then from here you can choose your measure style. Bounds will create a bounding box where you can click and drag your mouse to measure the pixels in the box you draw. You can also hold Shift to have your boxes persist until you cancel your selections. Spacing Will measure both vertical and horizontal pixels at the same time as you move your cursor around the screen. Horizontal and Vertical measure will do the same but only measuring one at a time. You can cancel any of these at any time by clicking the X or just hitting escape. There are a handful of options you can configure if you want to in settings. Shortcut Guide Forget what a Windows keyboard shortcut does? Check it quickly with Shortcut Guide! The shortcut guide is a nice little utility that shows common Windows shortcuts in an overlay. You can activate this by pressing ⊞ Win+Shift+/ or ⊞ Win+Shift+? If you’re looking for the forward slash. From here you can see all of the items you can lunch by pressing the ⊞ Win + the key you see on the screen. For example, it says the emoji panel can be opened with ;, so all we need to do is press ⊞ Win+;. Feel free to explore the other shortcuts on the screen. Text Extractor Extract text from any image using Text Extractor! Text extractor is a great utility to extract text from any image and copy it to your clipboard. It uses OCR to do this and it actually works pretty good. THis is great when you want to quickly grab text from an image or a screenshot. To activate it all you need to do it press ⊞ Win+Shift+T and then with your crosshair select the area that you want to extra text from. After selecting it will be copied to your clipboard where you can paste it. The text extractor can only extract languages that have the OCR language pack installed, so if you need to install additional languages I’ll have a link in my documentation on how to do that. Video Conference Mute Take control of your microphone and camera during conferences using Video Conference Mute! Now this PowerToy is in legacy mode meaning they won’t release any updates to it but it’s worth mentioning because it’s still available. I wouldn’t be surprised to see this go away since Windows is starting to support this natively without this Power Toy. Anyway… First you’ll need to be sure you run Power Toys as Administrator. You’ll need to close it first, then right-click and run as administrator. After you do this and visit the Video Conference Mute section you will see shortcuts for muting the camera and microphone. To mute both your camera and microphone you can press ⊞ Win+Shift+Q and you will see a little bar appear that shows that both are muted. You can press this combination again to toggle them both on. To toggle just the microphone you press ⊞ Win+Shift+A and to toggle the just the camera it’s ⊞ Win+Shift+O. If you want toi mute your microphone and toggle it only when you want to speak, you can use the push to talk feature by pressing ⊞ Win+Shift+I. This will unmute your microphone when you are holding this combination of keys. Again, this is a legacy feature that I personally don’t use but I want to cover it for completeness. Conclusion I hope you can see how powerful the Windows Power Toys are and how they can help you be more efficient at using Windows. There are so many useful utilities in this suite and more being added with each new release. I learned quite a few new shortcuts, and new ways of working on Windows, and I hope you learned something too! And remember if you found anything in this post helpful, don’t forget to share!

Want to power a mini PC or a smaller device with Power Over Ethernet (POE)? No problem! 📺 Watch Video How I use it Power Disclaimer: Be sure to check your device for the appropriate voltage and wattage. As with all power adapters, using something that isn’t intended for your device can break your device, switch, or both! Power Over Ethernet or POE. It’s awesome!. I have some small low power devices that have barrel plugs and they have these power adapters that take up a lot of space. Also, this ZimaBoard (and even Raspberry Pis) have a power switch to power on and off. To power it on and off I have to unplug it and plug it back in and unplug it and then plug it back in. I wanted to find a better way to power these devices, and that’s when I stumbled on this little POE adapter. This little adapter plugs into my POE switch and delivers power to the device. So it will pass through the network too. So if I plug it into my switch and plug it into the device, the device will power on. My POE Switch is managed too so I can use its console to power the device on and off. Now to power the device, I can just unplug the network cable! This adapter splits power and ether so you can power your low power devices It also has Gigabit ethernet!

I may receive a small commission at no cost to you.) My New Rack Over the years I’ve gone from machines on a shelf, to racking machines in an open rack, to centralizing everything and racking it in an enclosed 36u rack, to what I am building now, and that’s this new 12u closed rack. It’s a smaller version of my 36u rack with a few changes that make this the perfect rack for a small office, home office, or even just at home. But is it right for you? Let’s check it out and see. Hardware Introducing my 12u Sysracks Server Rack This is the Sysracks 12u 24” Wall mount 19” enclosure server rack. It measures almost 24” wide, almost 24” deep, and almost 25” tall. It’s a standard 19” rack and if you’re wondering why they call it a 19” in rack, 19” refers to the mountable width of servers and equipment. It’s made of steel and has a powder paint finish in either gray or black. It has 2 brush panels with cable managers at the top and bottom to help with cable management and block dust from coming in. All around the case you are going to see lots of perforated edges, especially around the front doors. This is to help passively cool the entire enclosure. It also includes active cooling with this top 120mm fan module that connects to any standard outlet. There are models, especially the larger units like my 36u rack that come with temperature control units, but I opted to keep this one simple and will probably add temp sensors and smart switches to control this fan if it ever gets to that point. Wait, I thought I said I was keeping it simple??? Speaking of power it also comes with a PDU where you can plug in up to 8 devices and has a a secure on/off switch covered in a detachable cap. I finally realized why they call these 19” racks In the back we can see wall mounting hooks which makes this easy to wall mount if you choose to do so but I am choosing to attach some casters so I can move it around freely in my office if needed. The back panel is attached with screws but can be easily removed if needed. On each side we have locking removable panels that can help you secure your enclosure and prevent anyone from getting in while still giving you access to get inside and make adjustments to your equipment. Coming around to the front we have this nice glass door that has perforated edges on the side and a handle that can also be locked if needed. I like having a glass panel door because it lets me easily see inside to check on my equipment plus it looks cool with all the blinky lights. Inside the rack has 4 posts to rack up to 12u of equipment making it great for small servers, networking equipment, DVRs, AV equipment, and anything else that can fit in a 19” short depth rack. It also comes with this shelf for equipment however I am not sure if I am going to use it or not yet. Assembling Putting it together was so much easier than my 36u rack. You can do it alone but it might help to have someone for the very first step and that’s putting together the frame. Don’t worry though, I was able to manage it alone. After securing the fame, you’ll then need to mount all of the posts so you can rack your equipment. Before you go too far like I did, if you’re going to use the supplied shelf be sure you adjust the posts so that you can mount the shelf later if needed. The back panel can be attached with a few screws. While I would have loved to see a door like on the 36u model, it makes sense for this to be a panel since it’s also wall mountable. The sides are removable and can easily pop in and out with these clips. It also comes with a lock and key to secure it if you like. Assembling the rack was pretty easy, you can do it with one person This model supports both legs and casters however it only ships with the legs. If you’re going to use casters too you’ll need to pick some up or buy them separately. I did choose to go with casters because I want to move it around the room when needed. The casters lock in place and are very secure, so secure that I didn’t worry one bit about assembling this on my workbench. Attaching the front door is pretty easy, but is a little challenging using the shims to get the door to hang just right. I love the look of the rack and I think the perforated edges and glass give it that premium feel. The door has a handle to keep the door shut and can also be locked with the included keys. Assembled As I mentioned the back is removable via screws, I do wish it was a door but it’s easy enough to take off and most people are going to wall mount this anyway. Once it’s all put together, It’s pretty easy to work on and get inside of the rack when it’s empty, plenty of room to work on everything I plan on installing. You can see the vents on the top for cables as well as the fan for cooling. I am glad I have a fan however it doesn’t have a switch to easily toggle on and off so I will end up wiring this up to a smart switch and put a temperature control inside if I ever really need to turn this fan on. Installing Things I started out by installing my UniFi 24 port POE switch. This was a switch that I replaced in my other rack but decided to hang on to it for this rack. I don’t think I will be using all 24 ports here in my office but it’s better than buying another switch. Rackstuds As you can see I am using RackStuds for this install. RackStuds reached out and sent me a few packs of studs including their new 1ru rack studs. These are awesome and so simple to use. You just squeeze them, pop them in, and then hook up your devices. These new 1ru RackStuds are great for 1u devices like my switch and PDU I put in back. Simple solution. But then I decided to put them to the test. I wanted to rack mount my UPS and that thing weighs 22 lbs and only has rack ears in the front rather than the front and back. I tightened all 4 using their combo pack studs and so far so good. RackStuds are able to hold them without issue and without sagging. Oh, and I wasn’t paying attention when racking my UPS and I racked it upside down, which I then quickly flipped around after noticing, but it was super simple with RackStuds. If you’re interested in the ones I used I’ll have some links below. This was my first time using Rackstuds, they were really easy to use. My Thoughts After installing the UPS, the network switch, and my PDU I took a look at the rack. It’s a really nice rack for short depth items, not to mention that you can use shelves for anything that can’t be rack mounted natively. I am really impressed by the build quality and attention to detail, glass door, and all of the other features - especially for the price. At just 210 dollars I was expecting a lot less but what I got was a perfect rack for my office. This is going to house a few projects coming up so be sure you’re subscribed to see what else I am going to put in it. Well I learned a ton about racking smaller components, building a mini rack, and I hope you learned something too. And remember if you found anything in this post helpful, don’t forget share! All in all, I am super happy with this new rack!

While CasaOS is a great fit for your Home Server projects, I also decided to walk through over 20 other home server projects you can start today. These projects are for everyone, from the beginner, to the tinkerer, to the hardcore enthusiast! Thanks to ZimaBoard for sending this device! 📺 Watch Video Where to Buy Check out ZimaBoard today!

I may receive a small commission at no cost to you.) What is a ZimaBoard The ZimaBoard has been out for a little while now but I thought it would be a great time to check in and see how it’s doing, along with the open source project CasaOS which ships with every ZimaBoard. I also wanted to share with you lots of projects you can start today with a ZimaBoard in case you need some inspiration for your tech projects. I’ll cover some of the easy or “beginner” projects that don’t take a lot of work to get going, then we’ll cover some of the projects for the Tinkerer, and then those projects for the hardcore weekend warrior tech types. But first, what is a ZimaBoard? Hardware The ZimaBoard is a self proclaimed “World’s First Hackable Single Board Server” Which means that it’s a complete functioning computer built on a single board circuit and while most don’t have expansion slots, this one actually does. The ZimaBoard comes in 3 varieties, the 232 has an Intel Celeron N3350 Dual core CPU, 2G of RAM, the 432 which has quad core Intel Celeron N3450 CPU with 4G of RAM, and the 832 which has the same Quad core Intel Celeron N3450 but has twice the RAM of the 432 for a total of 8GB of RAM. Introducing the ZimaBoard! Outside of those differences each ZimBoard comes with 32 GB eMMC storage, 2 SATA ports for disk drives, 2 Gigabit LAN ports, 2 USB 3.0 ports, and what makes this different than most kits you see out there is the PCIe slot that you can connect PCIe devices to, but more on that later. It also has a mini display port that can output up to 4k 60 and has a TDP of only 6 watts. It has a mini Display Port, (2) 1 Gbs NICs, (2) USB 3.0 Ports, and 12v power A few other things you might be interested in if you are a geek like me is that the CPU supports Intel VT-x for virtualization, VT-d for hardware passthrough, AES-NI for encryption, and video transcoding, all which will come in handy with some of the projects we’re going to talking about today. Beginner So first, we’re going to start with the “beginner” projects, but don’t be fooled by the name, this doesn’t mean that these projects aren’t technical, it just means that they take very little to get started. We’re going to start with one of the best uses for your ZimaBoard and that’s CasaOS. CasaOS CasasOS comes preinstalled with your ZimaBoard. CasaOS is an open source service, I’ll say and not necessarily an OS, it’s installed on top of Debian and many other Linux distributions but I still think that name is fitting. It’s software that focuses on delivering simple personal cloud experiences around the Docker ecosystem, and I think they’ve done a great job on delivering on that promise. You can launch it from the desktop on your ZimaBoard or you can simply connect to it from a web browser on your network. You’ll be greeted with a dashboard and a few widgets. We can see the time and date, our system status including CPU and RAM usage, our storage along with any additional connected drives, and our network status where we can toggle between our two network adapters. We also get a built-in search bar where we can search using our favorite search engine. There are two things you’ll be using this dashboard for: Installing and managing apps Managing the file system including shares. Apps If we launch the app store and take a look, we can see lots of applications that we can choose to install. The nice thing about CasaOS, is that every app you see here can be installed and configured with a single click. That means no messing with ports, account names, volumes, or any of the other typical things you have to do when installing Docker containers. Also, you don’t even need to know what a Docker container is. You can almost treat this as an app store without knowing any of the implementation details. Some of the apps included in the app store are: PiHole for network-wide ad blocking Plex or Jellyfin a media server Home Assistant for home automation - Nextcloud for a Google Workspaces like experience and many others that will help you build up your own little personal cloud in no time! CasaOS is a nice little open source service to run on your ZimaBoard and more! And if you can’t find the application you want in their app store, you can also run any Docker container you like by using the custom install feature in the app store and then either filling out a form, or using the import feature to paste the docker commands, Docker compose file, or appfile (which is an export you create to share with friends from your own apps). Importing configs will fill out the form for you. It’s kind of hit or miss if all the settings will be imported properly so it’s worth a look to make sure they are right. Once these apps are installed, if they have a web management page we can simply click on the app to launch it and configure it from there. Files App The other place where you’ll probably spend a lot of time is in the Files “app”. This app is a super elegant way to manage files and share and I think it’s one of the cleanest web file management UIs out there, not only because it looks good and is fast, but also because it makes sharing files super easy, let’s take a look… The Files app is a nice way to manage your files! After launching the files app we can see a default storage location for our media and documents and from here we can upload, download, and manage files if we like and it even has a built-in file previewer for different file types. If you want to share a file from here, you can simply share the folder from the menu, and then open it from any machine on your local network. That has to be one of the simplest ways of sharing files I’ve seen. If you want to see all your shares you can simply click on this share icon at the bottom and it will list all of your shares. Since we’re talking about sharing and we’re down here in the bottom left, we should talk about the FilesDrop feature. This is a cool feature similar to AirDrop for Apple devices, except it works on the web and with any device that has a browser. Let’s say for instance we are on our Windows machine and want to share a file with our phone. Instead of transferring the files through Google Drive and uploading and then downloading them on our phone we can simply do it all through CasaOS. If we click on the FilesDrop button it will launch a new experience where it shows my machine (the Windows Chrome machine) and then any other device that connects to CasaOS and visits this page will also show up here. When I connect my phone you should see another icon pop up. (It says macOS Chrome but should say iOS Chrome but that’s not important.) From my Windows machine I can click on my phone icon and then choose files I want to send to it. If I want to send this photo right here, I choose it, and then on my phone I will get a prompt to save it, I can then save it to my phone! I can also go the other way and upload files from my phone back to my machine, all without the cloud and from any device that has a web browser! FilesDrop is like AirDrop, but for any machine with a browser and only uses your local network connection! One other feature that you might be interested in when using the Files app is the availability to connect cloud storage. If we click on the plus we can add a Dropbox account, Google Drive, or even another network share on our local network. This feature is really cool for connecting and transferring things from your Google Drive to your own cloud or vice versa. This is also helpful for migrating to or from the cloud and could be even more useful if one day you can back up your data from CasaOS to one of these locations. Another thing you might be interested in is the storage feature. This feature is limited but allows you to add additional drives to your ZimaBoard in a snap. You just open the storage manager, and click create storage. You’ll get a prompt asking you if you want to add this device and that it will erase all contents from the device. Once it’s created you will see the device in the files app and you can use it for additional storage. There’s also this new merge storage option that will merge all of your storage into one, which seems like a simple way of expanding your storage but this also means that if one drive dies you might lose all of your data. I did enable it and it does exactly what it says, it merges multiple drives into one using mergefs. It’s also pretty easy to undo this too. You can add and wipe additional drives, and even merge them if you want! Now don’t let the simplicity of this UI fool you, you can still do some advanced things from the web dashboard like access to logs, access to a terminal, as well as the logs from each individual docker container and the ability to exec into them. All in all, I think CasaOS is probably one of the best projects for this ZimaBoard. Operating Systems The next project I can see people using this for is installing and running operating systems. Windows and Linux run fine on a ZimaBoard and I’ve tested it with Windows 10, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu server and I am sure many other distributions will run on this board because at the end of the day it’s a x86 intel based system. You won’t have any issues getting or installing drivers because it’s running on Intel hardware. Most things will be plug and plug and play and if you are going to go this route I would recommend picking up a USB hub and a solid state drive for additional storage. Then, you can run or test your software on this tiny little package. It does output to 4k 60Hz so it will look great on your display though it will start to push the limits on what you can do with this little board. Office apps, web browsing, watching video are all fine, anything outside of that and you might need a little more power. You could even dual boot Windows and Linux with 2 drives either by connecting 2 drives or by swapping them each time you want to boot but that’s starting to get into some of the more advanced use cases, and more for the Tinkerer. I’ve tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server and all run great! Tinkerers This next group of things you can do with your ZimaBoard is dedicated to the Tinkerers. These are folks who aren’t afraid of running Linux headless, know their way around a terminal, know how to exit VIM (first make sure you are not in edit mode and that you are in command mode and then press :quit, but if you’ve made changes… nevermind, you get the picture) The first thing I would recommend running on a ZimaBoard for this group is Portainer. Portainer is a great UI to run all of your containerized applications, some of the same applications we talked about earlier like Plex, Jellyfin, Nextcloud, and many others. This gives you a lot more control over which OS you run and which applications you run and you can keep it as minimal as you want, saving on resources. But with that comes a little complexity. But you’re a tinkerer, right? Emulation Station Another quick project that sounds like a ton of fun is Emulation Station which is the same software that Retro Pi is based on. Just install your OS, Windows or Linux, and then install Emulation Station and your emulators, connect to a few controllers and you are good to go. The ZimaBoard has all of the rest of the hardware you need to play retro games and is compact enough to bring with you on a road trip. You can easily build out an Emulation Station with a couple of USB powered controllers! Other uses for a ZimaBoard include some projects that I will definitely use this for and these are diagnostic and troubleshooting projects. Diagnostic &amp; Troubleshooting First is a disk wiping station. Having a dedicated little machine to securely wipe disks that I am no longer using is welcomed because my current solution is using an old janky PC. Having something this small and dedicated to wiping disks just makes sense after you use it. I can just boot to killdisk, start a wipe and walk away. You can easily connect HDDs and SSDs for a disk wiping station and more! Another thing I use that old janky PC for is updating firmware on devices, especially SSDs. This is usually the case when building new systems or replacing drives in existing systems. I can even do the same for NVMe drives with this PCIe adapter. You can also connect NVMe drives with this adapter Another thing I do with that old janky PC (sorry old PC) is clone disks. I use CloneZilla every now and then to backup or clone hard drives from one to another. CloneZilla has been my go to for years either backing up and restoring images over the network or doing a disk to disk clone. If you’re doing a disk to disk clone you will need to pick up this special Y adapter that lets you connect 2 drives at once, but it’s like 4 dollars in their store. One of the other use cases is simple data recovery. It’s nice to have a small simple machine that I can plug a drive into and run and try to recover files if the drive is no longer bootable. And all of this is easy and accessible using a ZimaBoard. What about a NAS? Now you may have noticed I didn’t mention NAS, that’s because I honestly think the best NAS you can use on this tiny little machine is using CasaOS, sure TrueNAS and OpenMediaVault should work but CasaOS already does this beautifully. And since you are a Tinkerer, you might as well install Debian headless then CasaOS to save resources! Hard Core The last group of projects is geared towards the hardcore. It’s for those folks who like to push hardware to the limits or experiment with something that they’ve never tried before. This is where I think the PCIe slot really comes into play. This PCIe slot can be used to connect any PCIe device as long as it can run in a x4 slot, which should be most because the slot is open here at the end. Most PCIe devices will fit into this slot since they end is slotted (Power but has limited power) While I know it’s technically possible to attach a video card to this device, I am not sure that a majority of the people who pick up this device will be doing so. I could be wrong, but I think more people will be attaching smaller devices like extra NICs, wireless adapters, and possibly more sata drives. While GPUs will fit, your mileage may vary on whether they work or not. Network Firewall, Hypervisor, and More! This opens the door for turning this device into a router or firewall. Having 4 cores, 2 gigabit NICs, AES-NI, and up to 8 GB of RAM make this a solid choice for pfSense or OPNSense, it’s small, compact, has enough compute and RAM, has dual NICs, and is completely silent. And if you want to turn this into an access point, all you need to do is add a wireless NIC and you a nice little OpenWRT system! Yup, you can even turn this into a Firewall / Router with a few extra NICs! But even if you’re not into creating a router or firewall and you’re the hardcore type there are plenty of projects for you. If you know RaidOwl, he created a high availability cluster with 3 using Proxmox. Which is another use case, and that’s installing a hypervisor. Because the ZimaBoard supports both VT-x and VT-d it can be used to test out the latest HyperVisor. And if creating and testing virtualization isn’t your thing, there’s the use case that I think that this is great for and it’s for developing and testing hardware. Most developers I know have laptops and don’t have access to a PCIe slot and that can be painful if you are working on a project that requires it, for example machine learning and AI. The Coral TPU from Google is a great example of how you can add a small PCIe device that is capable of doing AI in a small package, and if you can get your hands on one it could fit right in this slot. Having access to AI on a small board like this could let you do local detections from your video feeds so you can detect things like people, cars, and more. There are so many use cases for the hardcore that I could go on all day! If I could get my hands on a Google Coral TPU, it would fit right here (Hey Google, call me!) What do I think? ZimaBoards are super flexible and can be applied to many projects, whether you are a beginner, a tinkerer, or a hardcore enthusiast there’s bound to be a project for you. I am sure that I didn’t cover all of the projects you can do with a ZimaBoard and if I missed one let me know what you’d use it for in the comments below. Well, I learned a lot about ZimaBoards, lots of cool projects, and I hope you learned something too. And remember if you found anything in this blog post helpful, don’t forget to share! You can get an idea of how small the ZimaBoard really is next to this AAA battery!

I started using Renovate Bot to to track these for me and I now get pull requests from a bot for my Docker and Kubernetes container images. It’s a game changer. A HUGE thanks to Datree for sponsoring this video! Secure Your Kubernetes, Prevent Misconfigurations https://www.datree.io 📺 Watch Video Why use Renovate? How much time do you spend looking for updated container images for services you have running in your Kubernetes cluster? 5 minutes, 5 hours? Never? I used to spend hours a week checking for new container images, reading up on the changes, and not really knowing if it was going to break my cluster or not. It was super tedious doing this to the point where I almost stopped doing it. That’s when I discovered Renovate Bot. Renovate is a dependency update automation tool that scans your software, discovers dependencies, and checks to see if an update exists, and if there is one, it will automatically help you out by submitting a pull request on your code base. It works out of the box and supports a wide variety of languages and technologies, it’s highly configurable putting you in control of what gets updated and when, and it’s pretty smart too and can automatically detect dependencies and suggest ideas for improvement. Here’s the cool thing about it too, not only can it scan for all sorts of dependencies, it also gives you your choice of how you want to run it. Want to run it locally as a node module or from a CLI? Or in a Docker container? Or ever self host it in your Kubernetes cluster? No problem! Want to scan dependencies in GitHub, GitLab, AWS CodeCommit or other Git providers? No problem at all. One of the great things about Renovate is that because it’s open source, it puts you in control of how you want to run it, where you want to run it, and when you want to run it. So today we’ll be setting up Renovate bot to give us a helping hand with our Kubernetes resources. We’ll create a GitHub repo to house our Kubernetes deployments, add the Renovate bot to our repo, and then let it help us out by opening pull requests when it sees updates to any of the container images we’re using. Yeah… I feel like I just hired a devops engineer for free. Renovate works with many different source control providers like GitHub, GitLab, CodeCommit, and many others. You also have your choice of how you want to manage Renovate, meaning you can self-host it with Docker or Kubernetes, or run it as a GitHub app for free that’s hosted by Renovate’s parent company Mend. Create GitHub Repo We’re going to go with GitHub and the GitHub app because it’s super simple to set up. First we need to create a github repo, this is as simple as going to GitHub and well, creating a new repo. After naming your repo you’ll want to choose whether to make this public or private. The choice is up to you and Renovate will work either way. Note: if you want to see the repo I created in this post and video, you can check it out here technotim-k8s-renovate Create a repo in GitHub After creating the repo you’ll want to clone it to your machine. Now, I know that it’s empty, but we’ll be adding some things here shortly. After cloning it, I am going to open it up with a VSCode but any editor will do. Now that our repo is cloned, we’re going to add some Kubernetes resources so that Renovate can start analyzing our resources for updates. We’re going to create a simple nginx deployment and service. --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx spec: selector: matchLabels: app: nginx replicas: 3 template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.24-alpine ports: - containerPort: 80 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: nginx spec: selector: app: nginx ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 80 type: LoadBalancer For this deployment we’re going to use an older nginx container image tag because we want to see the Renovate bot actually work, so we’ll go out to Docker Hub and choose an older tag. We’ll then put that image tag in our deployment. Now that we have this manifest, let’s commit this code and push it up. Add Renovate Bot Now that we have a simple Kubernetes deployment committed to our repo, we should add the Renovate bot to start analyzing our code. We can do this by going out to GitHub, finding the Renovate app, and installing it in our repo. You need to authorize this app for your repo or org. Once you authorize this app and choose which repos it has access to you are all set! If you ever decide to change your mind and remove this app for your repo, you can go to the repo settings and remove this app at any time. Once the Renovate bot is authorized and installed, it won’t actually do anything until you merge a Pull Request that will be opened by the bot on your repo! This pull request is a special “onboarding” pull request that will show you what the bot has detected along with adding a default config for the bot. Renovate won’t take any further actions until you accept and merge this pull request. Once you have reviewed this PR, you can merge it in and it will activate the bot on your repo. Add the Renovate app to your repo Our First (Real) Pull Request After merging the onboarding PR, we can go and take a look at the logs for the bot on Mend’s bot page. Here we can see that it is trying to auto detect all of the various dependencies that the bot supports. It’s checking for ansible, docker-compose, flux, gradle, helm, and many other dependencies. But it doesn’t know how to handle Kubernetes files out of the box because Kubernetes files don’t really have a naming convention because there really isn’t one. So we’ll need to tell Renovate how to check for Kubernetes files in our config. Here you can see Renovate trying to scan our repo and automatically detect dependencies So we’ll need to git pull to get latest and we should see our Renovate config file. We’ll need to add the file match for Kubernetes files. You’ll want to be sure that you use the right extension here, whether that be yml or yaml, both are acceptable but I typically use yml so that’s what I am going to use here. { \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\", \"extends\": [ \"config:base\" ], \"kubernetes\": { \"fileMatch\": [\"\\\\.yml$\"] } } If you’re using FluxCD (as shown here) you also want add the flux extension and filematch. This will allow Renovate to scan your FluxCD manifests as well as creating Pull Requests for your Helm chart versions. { \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\", \"extends\": [ \"config:base\" ], \"flux\": { \"fileMatch\": [\"\\\\.yml$\"] }, \"kubernetes\": { \"fileMatch\": [\"\\\\.yml$\"] } } Once we’ve made that change to our config locally, we’ll then commit that change and push it up. Once we push this change up and it scans our repo, we can see a new issue that was created! This is a special type of issue that Renovate creates for us and it is kind of like a dashboard for all of our dependencies. If we look at this issue, it’s telling us that it detected a new dependency that’s related to Kubernetes and that it detected not only our nginx tag but also our Kubernetes API version for the deployment. Super awesome. If you like you can choose to disable this dashboard issue in your config, but I would recommend keeping it. If we look at the logs again from Renovate, we can also see that it detected our nginx deployment and that it created a PR for us to review. Now for the actual PR. We should see a new PR that was opened from the Renovate bot! If we look at this PR we can see the proposed changes, it’s suggesting that we change our nginx container image from 1.24 to 1.25 which is the current latest tag. If we’re happy with the change we can merge it into our code with just a click. How to Handle “latest” tag Now our code base is up to date with the latest container image. What happens if a container you are using only has one tag, say like the “latest” tag? Well, let’s find out. Let’s say for instance we’re running Wordpress in our cluster, and we create a deployment.yml and in our deployment.yml we specify the “latest” tag vs. a versioned tag. --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: wordpress spec: selector: matchLabels: app: wordpress replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: wordpress spec: containers: - name: wordpress image: wordpress:latest ports: - containerPort: 80 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: wordpress spec: selector: app: wordpress ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 80 type: LoadBalancer After we commit and push this up, we can wait for Renovate to check our repository again for new dependencies, or we can manually trigger one by going back to the dependency dashboard issue and check this box to trigger it to run again. Now, if we look at the logs again we should see that it detected Wordpress, however it is unversioned. The latest tag is nondeterministic, meaning that it is not deterministic, or simply put, it can mean more than one thing. Renovate can’t use this because it can’t determine what the current version is and what the next possible version is. So, instead of pinning this version to “latest”, we can actually pin it to a digest. So if we look at the current latest tag in Docker Hub and inspect the digest, we can see it here. It’s this long string of characters: DIGEST:sha256:75ba772cce073ec2aa6cec95c5ca229dfde9029c49874350a971499d567adae7 The digest is an immutable identifier for a container image and it is deterministic, meaning it can’t be changed and it only references one image. We can use that for Renovate. Once we have that, we can then pin our Wordpress container to this digest by using the like this, it’s: container image @ sha256 : digest Now if we make this change, commit this and push it up, we are now pinned to the digest which is also the same as “latest”. Again, if we want to force a scan instead of waiting, we can go back to this Dashboard issue, check the check box and then go look at the logs. We can now see that it detected our Wordpress container image along with the digest and it can now compare this to the current digest and open a PR if it needs to. If we take a look at the issue Dependency dashboard, we can now see that it detected Wordpress pinned to the digest. We won’t see a PR now because this digest is the latest digest, however if Wordpress releases a new container image with a new digest we will get a pull request to replace the digest. Awesome, so that solves the “latest” problem. Working with Helm Charts So that’s awesome, we have ways to work with Kubernetes manifests whether they are pinned to a versioned tag or an unversioned tag, but what about helm charts? Well, helm charts are just as easy. Let’s say we wanted to source control our mysql helm deployment, all we have to do is create a our helm values file and include the version as well as the repository. --- image: repository: bitnamicharts/mysql version: 9.9.0 persistence: enabled: true size: 10Gi architecture: replication auth: existingSecret: mysql-secret primary: replicaCount: 1 If you don’t specify the repository it will default to Docker hub, but as you can see here I am getting this chart from Bitnami. After we commit and push this up, we should now see a new dependency type of helm and since it detected an update we should also see a pull request to update this file! updating helm charts with Renovate are just as easy! Wrapping Up So now with Renovate bot we can keep track and upgrade our Kubernetes deployment and even helm charts but I bet you are wondering how you can deploy them? There are quite a few ways to deploy these resources using GitOps tools like Flux and ArgoCD, or even just a simple CI task that runs kubectl and or helm. I have a few videos on this topic. What about Docker deployments? Well if you’re interested in how to automate deployments with Docker and Renovate let me know in the comments below. Well, I learned a ton about Renovate Bot, how to add it to your Git Repository and how to automate Pull Requests when there are updates available, and I hope you learned something too! And remember if you found anything in this post helpful, don’t forget to share. Thanks for Reading! Join the conversation Keeping track of container image updates is hard. I started using Renovate Bot to to track these for me and I now get pull requests from a bot for my Docker and Kubernetes container images. Automation is awesome. It&#39;s a game changer.

Among the changes are: Debian 12 “Bookworm”, but using a newer Linux kernel 6.2 QEMU 8.0.2, LXC 5.0.2, ZFS 2.1.12 Optional Text mode installer (TUI) New default CPU type x86-64-v2-AES for VMs Ceph Quincy 17.2.6 and a new, stable Ceph Enterprise repository Authentication realm sync jobs ACL for network resources Resource mappings between PCI(e) or USB devices and nodes in a cluster and more…. Many have been asking how to upgrade, so I decided to put together an easy-to-follow post to get your Proxmox server upgraded to 8! Preparing the Upgrade to Proxmox 8 This might go without saying, but you’ll want to be sure you back up your Proxmox server’s configs as well as any virtual machines running on thi server. After you’ve done that, you’ll need to check to be sure you are running at least 7.4.15 or newer (If you need to upgrade from 6 to 7, see my post on how to do this). If you aren’t sure which version you are running, you can run this to check: pveversion This should output something similar to: pve-manager/7.4-15/a5d2a31e (running kernel: 5.15.108-1-pve) Next we’ll want to run an upgrade script to check to if there are any potential issues during the upgrade process. Don’t worry, this does not execute anything other than checks and is safe to run multiple times. You can run it by executing: pve7to8 You can also run it with all checks enabled by executing: pve7to8 --full You should see something similar to the following in the output: ➜ ~ pve7to8 --full = CHECKING VERSION INFORMATION FOR PVE PACKAGES = Checking for package updates..

As you can see there are a few warnings but nothing failing. The warnings I have listed are ones related to time packages (which I am going to ignore) and one related to machines still running. To resolve the second warning I will shutdown all the machines before I upgrade. Upgrade APT Packages We’ll want to be sure that we’ve applied all updates to our current installation before upgrading to 8. You can do this by running: apt update apt dist-upgrade If there are updates, I recommend applying them all, rebooting, and upgrading again if needed. Repeat this until there aren’t any up updates to apply. ➜ ~ apt update Hit:1 http://security.debian.org bullseye-security InRelease Hit:2 http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye InRelease Hit:3 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian bullseye InRelease Hit:4 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates InRelease Reading package lists...

Done Reading state information... Done Calculating upgrade... Done 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded. Updating APT Repositories Well need to update our Debian and Proxmox apt repositories to Bookworm: sed -i 's/bullseye/bookworm/g' /etc/apt/sources.list If you’re also using the “no-subscription” repository, you’ll also want to update those too: sed -i -e 's/bullseye/bookworm/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list Mine is actually at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-enterprise.list so I will run instead: sed -i -e 's/bullseye/bookworm/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-enterprise.list You can verify these files by checking to be sure they were updated with bookworm: cat /etc/apt/sources.list cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list or for me personally: cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-enterprise.list You should see something like this: deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-no-subscription Remember, you are just verifying the sed replaced bullseye with bookworm in each file. Upgrading Ceph If you’re running ceph you’ll want to check the Proxmox 7 to 8 Upgrade Wiki for a few additional steps. I am not running ceph so I will skip this part. Upgrade the system to Debian Bookworm and Proxmox VE 8.0 Now all that’s left is updating the system! If you’ve made it this far it’s now time to upgrade! I would recommend stopping or migrating any virtual machines and LXC containers before proceeding. apt update apt dist-upgrade This step may take some time depending on your internet speed and server resources. The upgrade might ask you to approve changes to configurations files. I am going to defer to the Proxmox documentation for this step, which is shown below: It’s suggested to check the difference for each file in question and choose the answer accordingly to what’s most appropriate for your setup. Common configuration files with changes, and the recommended choices are: /etc/issue -&gt; Proxmox VE will auto-generate this file on boot, and it has only cosmetic effects on the login console. Using the default “No” (keep your currently-installed version) is safe here. /etc/lvm/lvm.conf -&gt; Changes relevant for Proxmox VE will be updated, and a newer config version might be useful. If you did not make extra changes yourself and are unsure it’s suggested to choose “Yes” (install the package maintainer’s version) here. /etc/default/grub -&gt; Here you may want to take special care, as this is normally only asked for if you changed it manually, e.g., for adding some kernel command line option. It’s recommended to check the difference for any relevant change, note that changes in comments (lines starting with #) are not relevant. If unsure, we suggested to selected “No” (keep your currently-installed version) Verifying the Upgrade After upgrading all packages you can verify the upgrade by running: pve7to8 If all went well, you should see everything pass (or with minimal warnings). You can now reboot your system. After rebooting and logging into the system for the first time, you’ll want to clear your browser’s cache for pve web, or just hard reload: Windows (CTRL + SHIFT + R) macOS (⌘ + Alt + R) If you have more servers in your cluster, repeat this for each server!

This is similar to any of the “100 Days” challenges - pick a topic, stick with it for 100 days, and form a habit. Some of you might be asking what a “HomeLab” is, and I think in it’s simplest terms it’s a “lab environment” mostly at home. Think of this as a test environment to learn about technology without the fear of breaking anything. If you’d like to learn more about HomeLabs and how to get started, I summarized it in a video. After creating the challenge, I had lots of folks join in on Twitter, Mastodon, YouTube, Instagram and many other social networks using the hashtag #100DaysOfHomeLab, and it’s still going today! 365 Days of HomeLab I ended up sticking with it, posting on socials (when I remembered), and took it all the way to 1 year! While some posts seemed redundant and repetitive, I kept on building, breaking, learning, and posting. Once I hit 100 Days, I decided to see how long I could go. 100 days turned into 200 days, and 200 days turned into 300… and today I hit 365 days. Looking back at my very first tweet, it seems I missed a few days of sharing, or I am really bad at math. If you can spot where I missed or messed up, let me me know in the comments below! 😀 OK, my turn 😀Day 1 #100DaysOfHomeLab Since Day 0 was spent launching the video, planning, connecting with people, and celebrating 100k - today will be spent:Operationalizing the self-hosted website &amp; Bot pic.twitter.com/5EObleZiAV&mdash; Techno Tim (@TechnoTimLive) June 12, 2022 So what did you learn? Over the last year I learned so much about HomeLabbing, but specifically Docker, Kubernetes, networking, ZFS, GitOps, and many other related technologies. You can see all of my 100 Days of HomeLab tweets here however I will summarize some of the topics. Bots &amp; Website I started out by creating a Twitter bot that would retweet everyone who was joining the challenge. I felt like this was important to build and grow a community around HomeLab and a simple way to bringing people together. This is a self-hosted bot that I wrote myself, and even open sourced the code! I also decided to create a 100 Days of HomeLab website so people could learn more about the challenge and even showcase some of the creators I worked with to make this possible. Huge thanks to all creators, featured on this page or not, who joined in on the fun! What not to do Another bucket of learnings were what not to do. This can be seen as mistakes but I looked at them as opportunities. These were things like: Backup everything you can’t recreate (even if you think you don’t need it) Test your backups Don’t run beta firmware in production Don’t run early access firmware in production (I had to list this twice in case I think about it again) Don’t deploy and walk away (for hours) Try not to test in production (although sometimes there isn’t any way around it) Don’t over buy or over build hardware, unless you think you can repurpose or sell it easily in the future You may not always need the fastest connection like 10G (things will just take a little longer) Don’t delete CRDs in k8s unless you are certain you don’t need any of the resources What to do It wasn’t all bad, I also picked up some good habits and learned what I should continue doing in the future: Build a small test environment, even if it’s hard Create good documentation and write it as if someone other than yourself will have to follow the steps Write tests, when you can, even even when you think you can’t Have just enough hardware, repurpose what you can A little battery backup goes a long way Use DNS when possible (even if it’s painful) Use certificates, always Use strong randomized passwords Set up monitoring &amp; alerting, even if it’s just to yourself! Keep it simple. Seems like an oxymoron for HomeLab, but the simpler you keep it, the easier it will be to support Hardware I made lots of changes to my HomeLab over the past year, from a pile of machines on a shelf, to an open post rack, to a fully enclosed server rack in a room I converted to a server room. With this came new challenges like networking, power, and even RGB. I was sent a Storinator from 45 Drives and really expanded my storage while deprecating my old Disk Shelf. I also picked up a handful of low power devices and built a small low power cluster of Intel NUCs and rack mounted them in my server rack! Automation I also got to dive into Ansible deeper than ever before! Ansible is a powerful tool for automating things, especially infrastructure. I automated things like updates, configuration of my machines, password changes, and even building a fully HA Kubernetes cluster with k3s. The time spent learning this tool has already paid back in dividends compared to the time I would put into doing these task manually or even worse, pile up tech debt because I would skip them. I also picked up Terraform too! Terraform is one of those things you may not ever learn until you need to. It’s definitely been eye opening building up new infrastructure with Terraform. Every time I see a form or a UI to create some sort of Infra, I automatically think about how I can automate this with Terraform… but thinking and doing are two different things and I need to start doing this more often. I’ve already figured out how to apply Terraform to Cloudflare DNS and will be applying to more systems in the future. Networking Once of the biggest changes to networking wasn’t new hardware or network speed, but VLANs. I implemented VLANs here to keep all of my network traffic segmented according to the roles these devices fill. For instance I created an IoT vlan for all of my IoT devices, a Camera VLAN just for secure video devices, and Server VLAN for my servers that are used for public facing services. This helps ensure that not only am I not mixing traffic, but also minimizing the blast radius if one of my devices were to become compromised. I talked about this and more security recommendations in a video here. Highly recommended if you are going to self-host anything. Kubernetes The next big theme is Kubernetes and has been a theme on my channel almost since the beginning. I now run 3 HA Kubernetes clusters at home. That might sound crazy, but it’s true. It’s taught me so much about how to build, support, and maintain one of the most popular technologies in the world. It’s been challenging but rewarding at the same time. I ended up going all in and migrating all of my Docker only hosts to Kubernetes. I no longer have single Docker hosts (pets) and now have more Kubernetes nodes (cattle). Once I moved everything to Kubernetes, I quickly learned that I needed a better way to manage it than just a UI or applying manifests from the CLI. (GitOps has entered the chat) GitOps Git Ops, such a such a huge term and people have varying opinions on where it starts and where it ends - but it’s the idea that Git is the source of truth to deliver infrastructure as code. What does that mean for me and in my HomeLab? For me it means that my Kubernetes cluster (and custom code) is source controlled in Git and the only way to get those changes applied is through CI. This was one of the most rewarding things I have learned about during my 100 Days of HomeLab. All 3 of my Kubernetes clusters are defined in code (YAML) in a Git repository and when I need to make changes I just commit them to my repo and push them up and FLUX takes care of the rest. It has not only taught me how to deliver infrastructure as code but also taught me about secret management with SOPS which is such a valuable lesson, Kubernetes or not. I will be looking to expand into more IaC this year and beyond because this is truly the future of infrastructure. Community Last but definitely not least is community. Doing this challenge has taught me that there are so many other people out there just like me, trying to build/break/fix/learn with a lab environment at home. There are countless times where I have been inspired from others or even found better, more efficient way to accomplish things by interacting with the HomeLab community. I have even picked up new tech all thanks to you. I have met lots of people on socials and will continue to follow your journey! So, what are you waiting for?

I may receive a small commission at no cost to you.) My Mobile HomeLab This is my mobile HomeLab, or is it my mobile home lab, or just mobile lab, or a travel router ++, or ultimate mobile HomeLab, anyway, It’s a computer that I bring with me that serves as a network firewall, an access point, and a platform to run apps, services, and virtual machines. I guess it’s a cross between Wendell’s forbidden router and Network Chuck’s travel router. It’s something that I am going to take with me every time I travel and will provide internet access whether that be from an existing network, or one I connect to over my carrier’s mobile data network. A Mobile HomeLab device I can take with me that also provider network access! This is something that I have wanted to create for quite some time because when traveling I bring with me a few pieces of technology to make my life a little easier and keep my nerd brain fed. Some of these are common like a laptop and a tablet, but others aren’t. You see, when I travel I like to take a router with me to keep all of my devices connected securely, rather than connecting all of my devices to say the Air BnB’s WiFi. Bringing my own router assures me that my laptop, tablet, phone, pi, even security camera are connected to my router and that no other devices can spy on me. I’ve carried an old Cisco Linksys router with me every time I travel, and it provides a secure private network that only my devices can connect to. I can even take this a step further and use a VPN to connect all of my devices securely to my home network, where I get the same protection as I do when I am physically at home. This little router has worked great for quite some time, but I also started bringing a Raspberry Pi to provide a few more services on my local network. That’s around the time when I started thinking about how to combine all of the functionality into one package. Protectli reached out to me and said they wanted to give one of their devices a test run on my next trip and see if this combination of form factor and hardware would accomplish everything I needed out of my new “mobile homelab, forbidden travel router, plus plus, ultimate mobile homelab - thingie”? What I usually carry with me The Hardware This is a Protectli Vault VP2420 which, if you couldn’t tell by the huge heatsink on top, it’s fanless and silent. This model has an intel Celeron J6412, but it’s not like the Celerons of the past, this Celeron has 4 cores and 4 threads and has a base clock speed of 2 GHz and can burst to 2.6 GHz. What makes this CPU great is that it is super low power but yet still has features like AES-NI and VT-x and VT-d which makes it great for a hypervisor like VMWare or Proxmox. It also has QuickSync which can be used for video transcoding too. I opted for 32 GB of DDR-4 RAM , the most you can get on this device. This model comes with (4) 2.5 Gb ethernet ports for lots of hard wired connectivity options. But even more interesting than the wired options, are the wireless options. You probably noticed all of the antennas sticking out, now one set is pretty obvious and that’s one for WiFi. It’s a Protectli WiFi module that supports 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n and fits into the m.2 slot. The other antennas are actually for a 4g LTE modem that works most carriers. It even has a slot on the outside of the case that you can insert your SIM card into without opening the device up. As far as storage goes it has an internal 8GB eMMC module that I really won’t be using, and I opted for a 1 TB Samsung SSD. I would like to have another option for another drive, but I figure this was good enough for what I am going to use it for. As far as IO goes we have an HDMI port, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a Display Port, USB C, and a micro USB port for console access. It’s powered by this little brick and has a barrel plug for power. This is quite a capable machine for something that’s smaller than a tablet. All in all, it’s a solid fanless, quiet, yet power build. My Protectli Vault VP2420 with 2.5 Gb/s networking The Build So now that I have all of this put together (it came assembled) how was I going to build the ultimate mobile HomeLab? My original thought was to just run pfsense or OPNsense on this machine and use it as a router however, FreeBSD, the operating system that these are built on do not have drivers for this wireless NIC. That shut that down really quick. Then I noticed that Protectli have documentation on their site on how to set up this device with OpenWRT. That’s when I remembered Network Chuck’s video and decided that if he got it working, I could too. Well, not really because he’s like a legit networking person and I am just a hack, but anyway I thought I would give it a shot. I should have installed OpenWRT on Proxmox to begin with… So I installed OpenWRT. The process was a little bit complicated but I had some help from Stuart from the Protectli team and they updated their docs with the challenges we worked through. After getting it running, I quickly realized that I should have just used a hypervisor and created it as an OpenWRT virtual machine. This would allow me to make changes and back them up as I go. It would also allow me to install other VMs and containers that I can use while on the go. Proxmox So that’s what I did, I installed Proxmox on this machine since it supports virtualization and hardware passthrough. At first, I wanted to create an LXC container for OpenWRT to use less resources, however, it does not support hardware passthrough like virtualization does for network cards so I created a simple virtual machine. I found this great guide on creating an OpenWRT VM on Proxmox! The steps to create a VM were pretty straight forward and I followed each step on that checklist carefully. Once I had the virtual machine configured, I then passed through the devices that I need to run a router along with an access point. I passed through a NIC for WAN access, the wireless adapter for the access point, a USB wireless NIC for additional WAN access, and the USB modem for, well, WAN access for LTE. I gave it 2GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores, and the disk of only 512 MB. This is how big the disk image is. Now this might not seem like much but this is much more than I will ever need, considering this router that also runs a version of OpenWRT only uses 32MB of RAM and 8 MB of disk space. OpenWRT running as a VM on Proxmox OpenWRT Once the machine was up and running, I made some changes to the NIC and then went to the OpenWRT admin interface. The interface is pretty basic although it does come with dark mode, so that’s a plus for me. They also support a few different themes however I decided to stick with the default bootstrap dark. I configured a few initial settings like NTP, my router’d name, and then headed over to the software section. Here I can install some additional packages. I installed a few optional packages like nano, zsh, usbutils, and openssh sftp server, and htop for better monitoring. After doing this, it was now time to configure the network. NIC (LAN) First I wanted to be sure I could connect to this device via LAN. This was as simple as just configuring the virtual machine to connect to the bridge on Proxmox. This means when I plug in a network adapter to a port dedicated as LAN, I can connect to anything running on the Proxmox bridge. This will be the local area network for all of my devices on this subnet. If you want, you can configure DHCP on this OpenWRT interface but I am going to do that later with Pi-hole or even pfSense later. NIC (WAN) The next NIC I wanted to configure was the WAN NIC. This will be the NIC that is passed through to this virtual machine and will give it internet access if you have physical access to the modem or another switch. It’s as simple as assigning this NIC to WAN, and turning on DHCP. Physically plugging an ethernet cable is my preferred method of connecting this router to an upstream network like an Air BnB modem or any other network you don’t trust. After this step, the LAN and WAN should work by physically connecting Wireless NIC (Access Point) Now that I have LAN and WAN NICs configured, I can plug in my laptop and connect to this network. This works fine but really we want to broadcast our own wireless SSID so all of our devices can connect to it. This is where we’ll need to configure our Protectli wireless NIC. In order for this NIC to work, we’ll need to install the drivers and a few packages on OpenWRT to enable the wireless access point feature and we can do this within the software section. You’ll need to install a few packages and then overwrite a few files with ones from Protectli. They’ve found that some of the packages that are available on OpenWRT aren’t compatible so they’ve provided these files on their website along with instructions. Once that’s taken care of and we reboot we can now see this wireless section with our wireless NIC! Here we’ll want to configure the wireless network we want to broadcast for our clients to connect to. You’ll need to configure the SSID, security, and wireless mode. Now you should have a fully working router with LAN, WAN, and an access point! Pro tip, I found out that even though this is a dual band NIC, you cannot broadcast on both bands at the same time. So if you aren’t going to use 2.4 GHz you’re fine, you can set it to AC mode or N 5GHz, but if you are using any 2.4GHz devices you’ll need to set the mode to the lowest common denominator of 2.4 GHz. Another thing you can do is configure a second NIC to broadcast on 2.4 GHz, but we’ll talk about it a little bit later. Once you apply this, you should be able to see your new SSID and connect to OpenWRT! And if you have the WAN port connected to an upstream network, you should be able to use this as your router! But the fun doesn’t stop, there, not even close. USB Wireless NIC (Client / WAN / other) At this point you should be able to connect to your router and use the internet from the WAN port, but what if you don’t have access to the WAN port? This is where a second wireless network device comes into play. Let me be clear, this was the most complicated part of this whole project. OpenWRT supports very few USB wireless adapters. I tested 8 USB wireless network adapters before I finally found one that worked with OpenWRT. I tested name brands, no name brands, USB 2, USB 3, ones with odd antennas, and ones without external antennas at all. It turns out that most wireless USB adapters use a Realtek chipset and this does not play well with OpenWRT. It was hard to find one without a Realtek chip, but it turns out this tiny little no-name one works great and that’s because it’s based on a Ralink chipset, one that’s very hard to find. I tested 8 wireless USB NICs before finally finding one that works with OpenWRT So you’ll need to install a few more packages for driver support. I chose to install mt7601u-firmware` for this wireless USB NIC. After that you should see another NIC in the wireless section. This time we’re going to configure it as a client that connects to an existing wireless network, that way you don’t have to physically connect to the WAN port, we’ll connect over wireless. We can do this by scanning and connecting to an existing wireless network, and after that you’ll then have a completely functional router that can connect a wireless network and share it with all of your clients! I should mention that even though this works fine, this USB NIC only supports 2.4GHz / Wireless N. This is generally fast enough for the internet connection but just know that you are going to be limited by the speed of this NIC, which is around 150 Mb/s at most. Personally I would only use this option if you can’t physically connect your WAN port to your upstream router. As you can see, when I am connected to the WAN via this USB NIC, I can be a lot slower than when it is connected via ethernet cable. Now you should be able to connect your router to an upstream WiFi connection using this NIC! If you can physically connect to the WAN via ethernet, what I would do is disable this NIC or configure it to broadcast the same private network on 2.4Ghz this way you can set your primary NIC to use A/C/N 5 GHz. I had to do this to connect my Wyze cam since it only supports 2.4 GHz. Yes I take a Wyze cam with me when I travel so that I can keep an eye on the place when I leave and also keep an eye on my pups, Nano and Buddy, I bring a Wyze cam with me to keep an eye on the place! Now that I have this all working, I can now fire up my router and connect any of my devices to it and use my own secure wireless network. (Use my phone and connect ) After running a speed test you can see I am getting anywhere from 180/200 Mbps which is pretty decent considering I have 500 up/down here at home. I’m sure I could squeeze out some more performance if I tweak some settings but this is great considering everything is running on stock settings. LTE Modem So, not that I have OpenWRT working with an upstream router, what happens if I don’t have an upstream router at all? This is where the LTE modem that I mentioned earlier comes into play. This is great for times when you don’t have an internet provider where you are staying or if you decide to go and live the #vanlife. A tiny LTE modem inside! Installing the software on OpenWRt was pretty straightforward, again you install a few packages (kmod-usb-net-rndi, wwan, comgt-ncm) and then reboot. But before I rebooted I inserted this cheap testing SIM into my device. After rebooting, you’ll then go to network interfaces and add the new interface which should be USB0. You’ll want to set this as WAN as the firewall zone and then save and apply. You can then access the modem’s web GUI on a private IP address of 172.16.0 from a device connected to the LAN port. You should then see your device connected to your cellular provider and !viola! this connection can be shared with anyone connected to this device! Oh yeah, I did update the firmware too because I love updating firmware 🤷 If you use an LTE modem, you can now connect all if your devices to LTE data from your carrier! Pi-hole Now that I had OpenWRT working as an access point, a firewall, and a router that can connect to an upstream router via ethernet, wireless, or LTE, it was now time to focus on the “homelab” part of this device. Since I installed Proxmox on the host, I can now install anthony I want on this machine. The first thing I decided to install was a Pi-hole to keep every connected device safe and free of ads and tracking. Like all installations on Proxmox you have options of how you want to install things. I typically choose VMs but I wanted to keep this lean and mean, so I went with an LXC container. LXC containers are easy to manage and use less resources than a full VM. So I created an LXC container and set a hostname and password and uploaded my public ssh key. I chose the ubuntu template, then gave it 8 GB of disk space, 2 CPU cores, and 2 GB of RAM. For networking I connected it to the existing bridge, which is my LAN and gave it a static IP address. Once the LXC container was created, I updated it and installed Pi-hole. After installing I updated all of my ad lists. I also added about 5 millions sites to my block list that you can see here. Added Pi-hole to block all those ads and tracking on the go! I did end up enabling DHCP on Pi-hole just to see what it was all about. I usually let my router do this but for this travel router I wanted to have more control over blocking. I ended up disabling DHCP on OpenWRT and enabling it on Pi-hole. Portainer Awesome, so now I have Pi-hole with network wide ad blocking running, so what’s next? Well, I know I want to have docker as a platform for running applications on this mobile HomeLab device and portainer is the best way to manage them. I chose to create another LXC container based on Ubuntu and gave it a 60 GB hard drive, 4 CPU cores, and 16 GB of ram. I spun up the container and let it grab an IP, and then I reserved that IP inside of Pi-hole. Once the container was up and running, I updated Ubuntu and installed Portainer. Once Portainer was running I then installed a Watchtower to keep all of my containers up to date. I typically use GitOps to handle this in my home production cluster, but I don’t want to worry about updating containers while traveling. Installing Watchtower was easy, just copy and paste the docker compose and I was good to go. Installed Portainer to manage all of my Docker containers Apps So now that I have Portainer installed, we can install any container we like to and take it with us. For instance, we could install the super popular Plex or Jellyfin and take our media library with us. This would allow any connected device to stream movies from this device down to theirs, without an internet connection The nice thing about this Intel CPU is that it has QuickSync so you can hardware transcode videos if you need to, making sure that streaming is smooth on any resolution. I bet you’re wondering about disk space? Well, if you really wanted to take more than 1 TB of media with you, you could simply connect and attach a USB hard drive with your media to this machine and mount the drive to your Plex or Jellyfin machine. Doing some local Plex transcoding while on the go! Also, it does stop there, we can now install any docker container or LXC container we like, or even a full blown Virtual Machine since we’re running Proxmox! If we really wanted to, we could now install pfsense or OPNSense as a virtual machine and use that as our router and disable all the routing features on OpenWRT, and only use that as an access point. Once you have pFSense or OPNSense running, you can then create a VPN connection back home to get the same protection you have at home. The possibilities are really endless. Want to install other containers, like LANcache, Netcloud, or even a local Minecraft server, no problem. You can even go as far as creating a VPN tunnel back home! And that’s the nice thing about a general purpose machine like this, you have unlimited possibilities. And using the Intel Celeron platform you get powerful hardware, at a fraction of the power consumption so you get the best of both worlds. A WiFi router and access point that connects all of your devices, internet or not, and lots of services that you can use while you are on the go. I’ll be using this device full time when I travel so I will be sure to report back any modifications I make to this new “mobile homelab, forbidden travel router, plus plus, ultimate mobile homelab - thingie” Join the conversation This has been months in the making, my new Mobile HomeLab!

I may receive a small commission at no cost to you.) Smart Home Camera Fragmentation I have cameras in and around my house.I have cameras on the front door, cameras inside my house, cameras that point outside of my house, cameras in my garage, cameras in my server room, and even cameras in my server rack…. Don’t ask… All of these cameras work great and I keep all of the recorded footage in my home but what’s not great is that I am not able to tap into popular Home Hubs like HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home, or even Home Assistant.That’s because many of these platforms require some very specific requirements for adding cameras to your home hub.That means they might have to be certified, have to be compatible, and both manufacturers have to get along… and we know how that story goes. Getting ecosystems to play nice together So this left me with using one app to check my video, while leaving a whole host of features that my home hub provides on the table.Things like notifications within my ecosystem, the ability to trigger automation based on my eco system, cool features like picture in a picture on other devices, and all the things that make home hubs, well, hubs.And while I do like my home security choice, I don’t like that it doesn’t integrate with my home hub of choice.It’s not my fault these two companies don’t get along and I am not going to buy all new cameras just to be compatible with my home hub. That’s where Scrypted comes in. What is Scrypted Scrypted is open source software that you host on your own machine that allows you to connect almost any camera to any hub, that’s right, certified or not. You can connect popular devices from UniFi, Amcrest, Hikvision, Nest &amp; Google, Tuya, Reolink, and many others to your home hub of choice, whether that be Apple’s HomeKit, Google Home, Alexa, or even Home Assistant.This lets you choose and reuse your own devices and take advantage of the automation and integration you get with your home hub.That’s right, something the big players aren’t offering you, and that’s choice.This means that you don’t have to pay for that subscription if you want video outside of your home, you can use scrypted to connect to one of the major hubs or even an open source one like Home Assistant. Scrypted supports many different camera integrations and many Home Hubs! Here’s where it gets really cool… Scrypted is pluggable, so it allows developers to create and update plugins within Scrypted, giving them and you lots of flexibility.Want to connect a Google Nest Camera to Alexa? Sure! Want to connect a Reolink camera to Google Home, absolutely! Want to connect your UniFi Cameras to HomeKit? No problem! What about connecting some named or no name camera that only supports RTSP or ONVIF? Scrypted has you covered! Scrypted Requirements You’re probably wondering, what does all of this cost? Well, if you already have the hardware it costs nothing but a little bit of your time. The next thing you’re probably asking what hardware you need to get started, or maybe you’re not even asking that, but I will tell you that you will need some hardware to get started 😀 The requirements are actually pretty low and you can run it on the latest raspberry pi, or Windows, Mac, or Linux, and even Docker, either standalone or on many NAS devices like Unraid or Synology.It’s easy to set up and after you’ve connected your cameras to your home hub, you’ll be able to take advantage of all of the integrations your camera offers as well as automation your hub offers. So that’s what I am going after today, setting up Scrypted to connect my UniFi cameras to my HomeKit hub, which is one of my Apple TVs so I can use all of my cameras as if they are HomeKit Certified. Now wait, even if you don’t want or have this combination of devices and hubs, you can still follow along to set this up with any camera or any hub. Installing Scrypted with Docker So I first created a Linux machine and then installed Docker, which I highly recommend using, but if you don’t feel comfortable you can install it any other way you like.If you are using Docker, I recommend doing this on Ubuntu, but Windows Mac, or any other version of Linux will work just fine.If you’re using a Linux machine I recommend using Docker and Portainer.Portainer is a great container management system for Docker that has a great UI.The install is fast and painless and makes managing Docker really easy. Once you’re in portainer, all you need to do is connect to your Docker instance, add a container, and then set a few properties like the name of the container, the image name and tag, and then you’ll need to map your data volume from the container to the local machine.This should be somewhere your Portainer machine can read and write to, for me it’s just a simple path to a folder on the machine.The last thing they recommend is setting the network to host mode which means it will use the networking on the host instead of Docker networking.Once all that’s set, just deploy the container and you’re good to go. Installing Scrypted with Portainer is simple! Oh, and if you want to use Docker compose, you can use this to get started quickly! Note, this will also include watchtower to updated your stack automatically.If you don’t want to use watchtower just comment out that section. version: \"3.5\" # The Scrypted docker-compose.yml file typically resides at: # ~/.scrypted/docker-compose.yml # Example volumes SMB (CIFS) and NFS. # Uncomment only one. # volumes: # nvr: # driver_opts: # type: cifs # o: username=[username],password=[password],vers=3.0,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 # device: //[ip-address]/[path-to-directory] # nvr: # driver_opts: # type: \"nfs\" # o: \"addr=[ip-address],nolock,soft,rw\" # device: \":[path-to-directory]\" services: scrypted: image: koush/scrypted environment: - SCRYPTED_WEBHOOK_UPDATE_AUTHORIZATION=Bearer SET_THIS_TO_SOME_RANDOM_TEXT - SCRYPTED_WEBHOOK_UPDATE=http://localhost:10444/v1/update # nvidia support # - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all # - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all # runtime: nvidia container_name: scrypted restart: unless-stopped network_mode: host devices: # hardware accelerated video decoding, opencl, etc. - /dev/dri:/dev/dri # uncomment below as necessary. # zwave usb serial device # - /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0 # all usb devices, such as coral tpu # - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb volumes: - ~/.scrypted/volume:/server/volume # modify and add the additional volume for Scrypted NVR # the following example would mount the /mnt/sda/video path on the host # to the /nvr path inside the docker container. # - /mnt/sda/video:/nvr # or use a network mount from one of the examples above # - type: volume # source: nvr # target: /nvr # volume: # nocopy: true # uncomment the following lines to expose Avahi, an mDNS advertiser. # make sure Avahi is running on the host machine, otherwise this will not work. # - /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus # - /var/run/avahi-daemon/socket:/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket # logging is noisy and will unnecessarily wear on flash storage. # scrypted has per device in memory logging that is preferred. logging: driver: \"json-file\" options: max-size: \"10m\" max-file: \"10\" labels: - \"com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=scrypted\" # watchtower manages updates for Scrypted. watchtower: environment: - WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN=SET_THIS_TO_SOME_RANDOM_TEXT - WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_UPDATE=true - WATCHTOWER_SCOPE=scrypted # remove the following line to never allow docker to auto update. # this is not recommended. - WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_PERIODIC_POLLS=true image: containrrr/watchtower container_name: scrypted-watchtower restart: unless-stopped volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock labels: - \"com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=scrypted\" ports: # The auto update port 10444 can be configured # Must match the port in the auto update url above. - 10444:8080 # check for updates once an hour (interval is in seconds) command: --interval 3600 --cleanup --scope scrypted Configuring Scrypted Once the container is running, you’ll want to go to the machines IP address on port 10443 Once you get there you will be greeted with a sign in page where you will create an account and password.Once signing in you will see the scripted homepage! The first thing I did was turn on dark mode, of course, and then went into the plugins page and clicked install plugins. Here you’ll want to install the plugin for the platform you want to support.Scripted supports many different cameras and many different hub platforms, for instance you can search for Alex and see the plugins for Amazon Alexa or Google home and see the integrations for Google home, or even Amcrest if you want to find the amcrest camera plugin! There are lots of supported cameras but for me this is going to be unifi so I searched for unifi and installed it.Once it’s installed it will ask for a username and password for your unifi device.We need to create one in UniFi protect, but you’ll want to create a new local account and not provide yours! Installing the uniFi Protect Plugin for Scrypted Create UniFi Protect User So we need to go into UniFi and create a new user.We’ll have to do this in the UniFi console and what I did was create a new Role first that has Full Management access to Protect.The documentation says that you might be able to drop this down later to a Read Only user, which I may do, but I will create the user and give it admin access to Protect only.Again, be sure to create a local account and set the permissions appropriately. Once that user was created I then added the user and the password as well as the IP address of my UDM SE. Once I saved my credentials I could then see all of my cameras and you can view them now, however since I am going to use HomeKit, I need to add that plugin as well. You’ll need to create an account in UniFi Protect for Scrypted to use Adding Cameras to HomeKit So I searched for the HomeKit plugin and installed it.We don’t need to change anything in the plugin, I just reloaded the unifi plugin and went back into my cameras.Now you’ll see some additional options, one being HomeKit.You’ll want to be sure that this is enabled.I also made sure that the SnapSho tplugin was enabled too. Once this was set up, all I had to do now was just add the cameras to HomeKit. I did this by navigating to each individual camera in Scrypted and then clicked on HomeKit and then Clicked on pairing.It will then show you a QR code which you can scan and it will add it to your home in HomeKitI did this for all of my cameras, accepted the message about it not being an officially certified accessory, and then chose the default settings of stream while I am home and while I am away.The reason I didn’t change any of this is because I still still use my UniFi Protect for camera storage, rather than store it on my docker container. And for those counting, I have nine cameras…. Yes, 9 cameras… Awesome Integration &amp; Automation Now that we have this set up, what can we do with it? Well, now in the home app I can see all of my cameras at a glance.I can see the latest snapshot of each camera and drill in further to see a live view.I can pin the camera too so that I can multitask. Finally! Notifications on my Apple TV! I get notifications if someone presses the doorbell and I can talk with them too.Not only do I get notifications on my phone, but I also get them on my macbook, ipad, and even AppleTV - so just in case I am “super busy” watching something that’s “super important” I can decide whether or not to get my lazy butt off the couch. Here’s the other cool thing: Since I have an Apple TV, I can even say “Hey Siri” show me my cameras and it will show me all of my connected cameras.From there I can browse them, pick one to watch and even listen to, and even pin it to the screen so I can keep an eye on things or if I am expecting a delivery.If they are in the same zone as other devices, I can interact with these devices too, like toggling on and off the lights on my porch. Picture in a Picture on my TV!_ More Scrypted Compatibility One of the things I like most about Scrypted is that I can use almost any camera I want and I can connect it to one of many platforms.Now, I obviously connected UniFi cameras to HomeKit, but you can connect almost any camera to any platform.Want to connect some old PoE cameras to Alex or Google Home Hub, or even Home Assistant? No problem.That’s the beauty of Scrypted, is that it’s pluggable and can connect almost any camera to any Home Hub.Well, I learned a lot about Scrypted, HomeKit, and Unifi Protect and I hope you learned something too.And remember if you found anything in this video helpful, don’t forget to like and subscribe.Thanks for reading and watching!

This will: create a ConfigMap “reflect” the same ConfigMap to namespace-1 , namespace-2 and all other namespaces that match the pattern namespace-[0-9]* Certificates This is the real reason I brought this chart into my cluster, was support for cert-manager certificates. There are many cases where I need to create the same certificate in multiple namespaces and rather than create them manually, I have reflector create them for me. apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: Certificate ... spec: secretTemplate: annotations: reflector.v1.k8s.emberstack.com/reflection-allowed: \"true\" reflector.v1.k8s.emberstack.com/reflection-allowed-namespaces: \"namespace-1,namespace-2,namespace-[0-9]*\" ... This will: create a Certificate “reflect” the same Certificate to namespace-1 , namespace-2 and all other namespaces that match the pattern namespace-[0-9]* The benefit of doing it this way with cert-manager is that when your certificates are updated with something like Let’s Encrypt, all certificates you reflect are also updated! Of course you will only want to limit your reflections to other namespaces you trust.If you’d like to check out cert-manager see my post on how to install traefik and cert-manager!

I may receive a small commission at no cost to you.) Hardware These Intel NUCs are probably my favorite small form factor devices.They are only 4x4 inches and pack quite a punch.That’s because these NUCs have anywhere from a Core i3, to a Core i5, to a Core i7 processor in them.This one has a Core i7 with 4 cores and 8 threads and has a base clock speed of 2.8 GHz and can turbo boost up to 4.70 GHz.It even has QuickSync on this chip too so that I can offload encoding if I need to.You can check out the specs here. My Intel NUC Cluster! I maxed out the ram on each machine, giving it 64 GB of DDR4 RAM.Should just be just enough to run some of my workloads and another reason I chose not to run a hypervisor on these machines, I wanted to conserve resources.I added a 1 TB Samsung NVMe drive for the OS and to run all of my workloads, and then a second SSD for additional Kubernetes storage that will be replicated across all 3 devices.I may expand this in the future however this was one of many SSDs I had laying around. Intel NUC Internals Installing in the Rack So once I had all of the hardware buttoned up then I had to decide where exactly I was going to put these devices.Now I could have put these on my workbench or my desk, but I have a server rack in my basement that I wanted to take advantage of.I have a few general purpose shelves but I thought that these NUC deserved a little bit better home than that.I wanted a rack mount system that would hold 3 NUCs, hold them securely in place, and even give me some cable management and that’s when I found this small company that makes all kinds of small form factor rack mount systems.Mk1 Manufacturing makes all kinds of rack mount kits for small form factor devices like Mac Studios, Lenovo ThinkStations, Mac Minis, and of course Intel NUCs.The nice part about these racks too is that they are made here in the US. I purchased one for my Intel NUCs and quick rack mounted all 3.It was super easy to mount these and they even thought about the cable management for both power and networking. Intel NUC, 1U Rack Mount System Remote Control I bet you’re wondering how I remote control these devices, because I wondered that too.Well, if you remember from a previous video, I picked up a PiKVM and I was able to attach multiple devices to it using an HDMI switch.Ths current switch lets me connect up to 4 devices, but I am going to try to expand to 8 later on. From the PiKVM I can even power on these devices using WAKE ON LAN that will send a magic packet to wake them up.And in the case that Wake On LAN doesn’t work, I can then use my UniFI Smart PDU Pro to toggle the power off then on to force them to wake up. Intel NUC, 1U Rack Mount System Operating System After getting this all hooked up and on my network, I then had to figure out how I was going to get an operating system on them.I ended up using MAAS or metal as a service to boot and provision these machines.I chose to go with Ubuntu server for these, well, because I like Ubuntu and so is the rest of my infrastructure so it makes it really easy to manage it.I was sure to reserve a static IP for these devices as well as create a DNS entry for them. Why Kubernetes Now, for the most difficult part of this all, installing kubernetes.I bet you’re asking, why Kubernetes? Because. Kubernetes So to install Kubernetes I can do it one of a million different ways and on top of that I have my distributions to choose from.I ended up going with k3s because I like how lightweight that it is as well as the active community behind it. As far as installation goes I could spend the 20+ hours doing it manually but I’ve already created an Ansible playbook that can do this all for me.It does everything that I need to give me a high availability Kubernetes cluster, with both an HA Kubernetes API as well as an HA service load balancer.With three nodes I can lose 1 node and everything will still function normally. After setting my IP address it was off to the races. 🚀 I sat back and watched the automation run for about 3 minutes, and shortly after that I had a highly available Kubernetes cluster to run my workloads.If you’d like to do the same thing I will leave a link to the documentation and the video where I walk you through all of this. Running the k3s-ansible playbook Installing Apps &amp; Services So once I had Kubernetes installed I then copied my kube config file locally so I could communicate with the cluster.I was able to ping the Kubernetes API that is really a VIP and it responded.I then asked Kubernetes to show me all of my nodes and there they were, all three of them.So that was there to do next? Next I wanted to install some workloads to test out HA.Now typically I would install Traefik as my reverse proxy and cert-manager to manage my certificates, and LOKI, Grafana, and Prometheus for logging, monitoring, and visualization; however I just wanted to test out a few things before I go all in. So I decided to install a simple web server that runs nginx to host it.This web site is just a tiny nginx web server that services a single page that shows its hostname, IP address, and port, and a few other things.This was going to be a good test to test high availability. My plan was to create this workload with 3 replicas and then pull the plug on one of the nodes and make sure that both Kubernetes was still up as well as this web page. So, that’s what I did. I created a Kubernetes deployment for this container and set the replicas to this.This will ensure that 3 are running but I wanted to be sure that they were spread out across all three nodes.I did this by setting a typology constraint of hostname.This will make sure that only more than one pod is never scheduled on the same node so that I can ensure HA. --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx spec: selector: matchLabels: app: nginx replicas: 3 template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginxdemos/hello ports: - containerPort: 80 topologySpreadConstraints: - maxSkew: 1 topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule labelSelector: matchLabels: app: nginx So once this was set, I then deployed the Kubernetes deployment and could see that I had 3 pods, all spread across 3 nodes, awesome. But how to I actually get to this web page? Well, remember how I mentioned that I typically use Traefik as my reverse proxy? Well, that’s where this would come in handy.It would allow me to expose multiple services on the same IP, but since I don’t have it installed, I will just expose it on the metal lb load balancer that comes with my playbook. To open up an IP on the virtual load balancer, all I have to do is create a service with a type of LoadBalancer.This will expose the service on one of the Metal LB Ip addresses so that we can see our web page. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: nginx spec: ipFamilyPolicy: PreferDualStack selector: app: nginx ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 80 type: LoadBalancer After deploying that service, we can then check the service to see which IP address it was assigned.Once we have that IP address we can then get to this web page. After, we see our web page here so we know it’s working.And it should be HA because we have one of these pods running on each of the servers! NGINX demo page Now we need to introduce some chaos. No, no no no, not that much chaos, just simply removing one of the nodes. So, before doing that let’s ping our Kubernetes API to be sure that it ups, and you can see it’s up and responding.Next let’s open the web page and keep refreshing it. Now, we can introduce chaos by shutting down one of the nodes.I can pick anyone that I like but let’s go with 2.Let’s also ping node 2 so you can see it going down. So we shut down node 2 and wait.We can see that it’s down but out Kubernetes API is still up.We can do a kubectl get nodes and see all of our nodes, and if we refresh our web page we can see that the web site never went down.Now if we shutdown one more now, we will lose access to our Kubernetes api and web page, so let’s shutdown node 1.And as you can see we can’t get to it anymore, but if we bring up node 2 and leave node 1 down we can. Testing my HA NGINX install, you can see that node 2 is down, but the Kubernetes API still responds and the web page is still up! What else can we do? Awesome, so now we have an HA cluster but what can we do with it? Well, I mentioned a few things but you can do some awesome home Kubernetes stuff like install Home Assistant, game servers, web sites, or many other workloads, just remember that not all workloads can be HA out of the box, they have to be stateless like my nginx container, meaning they have no state like storage mounts or state in memory, but they get their state from outside of the container like an external database. This diagram explains how stateless Kubernetes apps should be architected How efficient is it? I bet you’re wondering how much power these three devices use, well I wondered the same thing and I checked my UniFi PDU to be sure.I let all three NUCs run a few workloads and kept them on for a few hours and each of them uses about 20 watts of power.Keep in mind that my PDU only shows average power over time so I think they are using anywhere from 15-25 watts.Is that as good as a raspberry pi? Well, no, but what I do get is an x86 processor with 8 cores, lots of high speed storage, 2.5 Gigabit networking, AES instructions, and even a GPU for quick sync if I wanted to do any kind of transcoding.Also, it has enough compute to run anything I can throw at it because remember it’s a core i7. Each Intel NUC only uses around 9 watts of power on average, with an idle k3s cluster! What do I think? So, what do I think of these lower power, small, yet powerful devices? Well, I think they are pretty awesome if you couldn’t tell by the fact that I bought 3.You can find these devices relatively cheap if you go with a model from a previous year.Is it as cheap as picking up older small form factor desktops? It’s not, what that might be a perfectly fine option for you if you want to save some money, but I didn’t have 3 devices that I could keep around for years to come, not to mention that I still have my first NUC from almost 9 years ago. These little devices are great for servers, especially if you are considering clustering them.And rack mounting them is a great solution if you’re thinking about picking up a few. Well, I learned a lot today about low power servers, Intel NUCs, and cluster Kubernetes and I hope you learned something too.And remember if you found anything in this video helpful, don’t’ forget to share, like, and subscribe.

No Way! Yeah, I thought you’d say that. 📺 Watch Video You might have heard of Protectli before.They’re known for making really great appliances for many open source software distributions.Most people think of Protectli devices as the perfect device for a router like pfSense. And that makes sense considering that their devices come with anywhere from 2 - 6 network ports.But their devices can be used to run almost any software imaginable, from Linux, to Windows, to a dedicated firewall, to even a virtualization host or a hypervisor. How is that possible? Where to Buy A HUGE thanks to Protectli for sending this device for me to test! Protectli Vault FW2B - 2 Port - https://amzn.to/3nRJfM1 Protectli Vault FW4B - 4 Port - https://amzn.to/3nVVU0u Protectli Vault FW6A - 6 Port - https://amzn.to/3zHWHop Protectli Vault Pro VP4630-6 Port - https://amzn.to/3GoYSRy Crucial RAM - https://amzn.to/41eks31 Samsung NVMe - https://amzn.to/3KIsKuD Samsung SSD - https://amzn.to/43fYb6Z See the whole kit here! - https://kit.co/TechnoTim/building-a-low-power-all-in-one-silent-server CPU That’s possible because of the hardware that these devices ship with.Protectli sent me a VP4560 to help with some of my HomeLab projects and this device is a beast. This is the VP4650 and comes with an intel Core i5 quad core CPU with hyper-threading that is rated at 1.6 GHz and can turbo boost up to 4.2 GHz.The nice thing about this CPU is that it supports VTx for virtualization and VT-d for IOMMU so I can pass through devices though to the guest.And because it’s an Intel x86 processor it comes with AES-NI support, which is super nice for encryption / decryption for VPN or TLS. Memory It supports up to 64GB of RAM which is plenty for what I will be using it for, but you can scale back if you need, all the way down to 4 GB. Network It comes with 6 intel 2.5 gigabit NIC ports giving you enough throughput for most of your networking needs. Protectli VP4650 has 6 - 2.5 Gb/s network ports! Storage It also ships with a 16GB eMMC module on board and many options for storage.Also, because this machine has an NVMe slot and a SATA port you can mix and match your storage to fit your needs.I opted for a 1 TB Samsung M.2 NVMe and a 1 TB Samsung EVO drive. Protectli VP4650 Internals Extras You also get the choice of adding WiFi modules and 4g LTE modems however I decided not to on this device because they also sent a lower powered VP2420 that has 4 network ports along with WiFI and LTE modules to help me build the ultimate router which you’ll be seeing in a future video. Protectli Ultimate Router (Coming soon!) Cooling If you noticed from everything I listed, you didn’t hear anything about fans.That’s not something that’s obvious from the specs on paper, but taking one look at this device you can see this huge heatsink that passively cools the entire device.It definitely looks like a grill but I promise you can’t cook anything on here. Connectivity Protectli devices come with plenty of options to connect all of your other devices devices_ As far as connectivity goes, you have plenty of options for connecting devices, from USB 2.0, 3.0, USB C, to HDMI, to Display power, and even a micro USB port for console access. BIOS You can choose between AMI BIOS and and open source BIOS called “coreboot”_ One thing that I like about these devices is that you have your choice in firmware to use.You can use a standard AMI BIOS that works great, or your can use coreboot BIOS, which is a bare bones open source BIOS that lets you customize some cool features.For instance, if you flash their devices with core boot, you can boot to the network and download and install many different operating systems from the network.This is a neat feature that I welcome and it saves you the hassle of loading up that Ventoy USB disk with new ISO.I did however opt for AMI BIOS because I did have a few issues with coreboot related to using my Ventoy USB disk.But that’s the nice thing about this BIOS being open source, it will get better and more secure over time with more eyes looking at it and more engineers contributing to it. The Build So what did I do with all of this hardware? The better question is what didn’t I do? I knew that I wanted thai build to be a complete silent hypervisor and I knew that it was going to run Proxmox. The first decision I had to make was where I was going to install proxmox.Remember I have the choice between the NVMe drive, the SATA drive, and the eMMC module.Turns out the eMMC mobile isn’t really an option because Proxmox won’t let you install it there without some hacks and I didn’t want to hack this device so I decided to install it on the NVMe drive and use the rest of the partition for virtual machines.Typically I would have installed the OS on the slower drive and save the NVMe for VMs but I have other plans for that. Installing Proxmox was straightforward, just like any other Proxmox installation.After it was installed I then configured IOMMU so I can pass devices through to guest machines and everything else I have on my First 11 Things on Proxmox video.After that was all set it was now time to install some VMs. Router I knew that I wanted to install a router on this machine.This will give me the flexibility to run a network firewall for all of these devices and give me the option to protect any device I use when I travel, but more on that later. So I installed pfsense, and passed through 2 NICs from the host down to the guest. This first NIC is the WAN port, so an upstream provider like an ISP or even some network I don’t trust, and then one port for LAN if I do want to connect all of these devices to the local network. Passing these through and configuring them was pretty simple and if I forget which port is which they even included some stickers for me to label the ports.I also added another network port that’s used as a network bridge in case I want these VMs to use an internal network. Protectli Network interface stickers NAS Now that the router was done, I wanted to configure a NAS on this device.This NAS could be any open source NAS but I chose to go with TrueNAS SCALE.I went with TrueNAS because, well it’s TrueNAS,and I went with SCALE because I wanted a Linux based OS that plays better with Proxmox.After installing TrueNAS I then created a 1 TB drive in Proxmox and assigned it to TrueNAS so that I can have 1 TB of storage on my NAS.I know it’s not ZFS and I don’t have redundant drives, so if you do the same you’ll want to be sure that you have your data backed up to another machine.Once I had TrueNAS up and running I could set up NFS and Samba shares just like I would normally with a physical install.I can also pass through one of the NICs to my NAS so that it can have a dedicated 2.5 Gb/s NIC if I like. Ubuntu Server + Portainer Next up I needed something to run my containers.Yes, I know I can use TrueNAS to do that but I wanted to go with my preferred combination of Ubuntu Server + Docker + Portainer.Having a dedicated Ubuntu server running Portainer gives me a great UI and so many possibilities.After installing and configuring I then created a few containers.This is a perfect host now to run all of my self-hosted services. Desktop After getting my foundation all set up, I then had my choice of desktop OSes.I could choose between Windows and Ubuntu Desktop, then I looked at how much disk space and RAM I had left and I thought to myself, why not both.This is where things got a little bit interesting too. I first installed Windows 11 and configured it, no problems there, but after installing Windows I wanted to passthrough the GPU on the device to the VM, along with sound card and USB devices so I could use this all in one server as a desktop too.After messing with this for hours I could not get the single Intel GPU to display anything on the screen even though it was definitely passed through to the guest machine and I could see it over Remote Desktop.I thought maybe it was Windows 11 so I created a Windows 10 machine and it did the same thing. Ubuntu Virtual machine running on Proxmox with the hardware passed through from host to guest so I can use it as a desktop simultaneously So I decided to try it again, but with Ubuntu Desktop and sure enough it worked! I was able to pass through the integrated GPU front he host down to the guest and use this machine as a desktop.I will be the first to admit that it wasn’t winning any performance awards but I was able to do most tasks that I would expect to do on a laptop.I installed VSCode, customize the desktop, watched some YouTube, and even passed through the thermal subsystem so I could monitor the temperature of the host. After I had this working I decided to install Plex on this machine so that I could see if I could get QuickSync working.QuickSync is a technology and a dedicated chip on most modern intel processors that lets you off load decoding and encoding video from the processor to this chip.This technology is similar to NVENC from NVIDIA, and AMF from AMD, but the idea is that you give this work to another part of the processor instead of pegging all of your CPU cores.Plex can take advantage of this if you have a plex pass and I do, so I wanted to see if I could get it working. That’s where I started to run into troubles.I thought that since I had the GPU passed through to this Ubuntu machine that Plex would just see QuickSync and use it. No matter what I tried I could not get Plex do hardware encoding, I even tried using Docker containers which supposedly should work if the hardware is mapped properly however I couldn’t get it to work. I could see the Intel GPU using Remote Desktop on Windows Then I decided to try my Windows VM.I could see the Intel GPU when using Remote Desktop so there was hope.Sure enough that when I installed plex and started streaming a video the hardware enabled transcoding kicked it and the CPU barely budged! I was able to transcode 3-4k streams down to 1080, 720, and even 480, no problem! I could encode 3 - 4k streams on Plex using Intel’s Quick Sync! This was awesome and puzzling at the same time.The WIndows machine could see the GPU and take advantage of QuickSync but I couldn’t output the display from the HDMI or DisplayPort, and the Ubuntu machine could output to the monitor over HDMI but couldn’t use QuickSync.Judging by the fact that I was able to cover both of these use cases with different operating systems this told me that it’s something with software and not hardware so I chalked it up as software issue and it may be fixed some day. Power Protectli VP4650 power draw with 4 virtual machines running and hardware attached You might think that running 4 virtual machines on this device would draw a lot of power and generate a lot of heat.Well, I thought the same thing until I pulled out my kill-a-watt and decided to measure it.This Protectli machine running 4 VMs and the host itself with all of these devices plugged in pulled anywhere from 20-30 watts, which I think is pretty good considering I have all of this functionality in one device.If I wanted to save some more power I could power down any of these virtual machines when not using them. Protectli VP4650 temperatures with 4 virtual machines running and hardware attached And as far as heat goes? Well, do you hear that fan? That’s right, no fan equals no noise but that also means that it’s going to heat up these fins.As you saw earlier that the thermals were around 56 celsius on the die, it’s actually much cooler on the heatsink fins so you definitely can’t cook anything on it. Final Thoughts As you saw I was able to create quite a few virtual machines and spin up an absolutely quiet hypervisor and use it as a desktop, which goes to show just how flexible these devices are.If you go with Protectli you are getting a blank slate where you can create and build anything you want.From a full fledged server with virtual machines to a small dedicated development environment. Now it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t mention some of the beefs I have with it too.Remember that eMMC drive I mentioned? Well, if you’re planning on using it with Proxmox it’s almost useless.Proxmox can’t be installed on that device and even if it could it’s only 16GB.I’d love to see another option other than the eMMC module or even space for another SSD.The other things that some mention is the price.These devices are a little more expensive than some of the other small form factor devices out there, so I wish the price would come down just a bit.However these devices are purpose built, have lots of customization options like WiFi and 4g LTE, are industrial quality, offer support for all of their devices, and allow you to swap out firmware for coreboot anytime you like and those options might be enough for you to justify the premium cost, because I think these are truly premium devices. Well, I learned a lot about running Proxmox on Protectli devices and I hope you learned something too.And remember if you found anything in this video helpful, don’t forget to like and subscribe.Thanks for reading and watching! Configuration Here is my configuration for each virtual machine on my Proxmox server.Please note that (as seen in this article and the video) I did have issues getting the Windows machines to output their display to a physical monitor however Quick Sync to encode videos worked just fine and I could output the display using Ubuntu desktop however I could not use Quick Sync.If you have a fix, let me know in the comments! pfSense boot: order=virtio0;ide2;net0 cores: 4 cpu: host,flags=+aes hostpci0: 0000:06:00 ide2: none,media=cdrom memory: 2048 meta: creation-qemu=7.2.0,ctime=1680150221 name: pfsense net0: virtio=12:70:A1:22:F9:2F,bridge=vmbr1 numa: 0 ostype: other scsihw: virtio-scsi-single smbios1: uuid=0388a78d-7950-49e7-8ef9-19a9744e8ee2 sockets: 1 startup: order=1,up=30,down=30 vga: qxl virtio0: local-lvm:vm-100-disk-0,discard=on,iothread=1,size=20G vmgenid: 314798d0-820e-40bd-89ad-ac364b03b83c Windows 11 agent: 1 balloon: 0 bios: ovmf boot: order=ide0;ide2;virtio0;net0 cores: 8 cpu: host efidisk0: local-lvm:vm-101-disk-0,efitype=4m,pre-enrolled-keys=1,size=4M hostpci0: 0000:00:02,pcie=1 hostpci1: 0000:00:12.0 ide0: local:iso/virtio-win-0.1.229.iso,media=cdrom,size=522284K ide2: none,media=cdrom machine: pc-q35-7.2 memory: 32768 meta: creation-qemu=7.2.0,ctime=1680233057 name: windows-11 net0: virtio=DE:AB:E8:6B:9F:B7,bridge=vmbr2,firewall=1,tag=60 numa: 0 ostype: win11 scsihw: virtio-scsi-single smbios1: uuid=5f7d30a5-b3df-4a29-800c-730c7a43668d sockets: 1 tpmstate0: local-lvm:vm-101-disk-1,size=4M,version=v2.0 vga: std virtio0: local-lvm:vm-101-disk-2,cache=unsafe,discard=on,iothread=1,size=10&gt;vmgenid: 9193bc41-1b82-4069-bc42-8cbb0dfca31d Ubuntu Desktop agent: 1 balloon: 0 boot: order=scsi0;ide2;net0 cores: 8 cpu: host hostpci0: 0000:00:02,pcie=1,rombar=0,x-vga=1 hostpci1: 0000:00:1f hostpci2: 0000:00:1a hostpci3: 0000:00:12,pcie=1 ide2: none,media=cdrom machine: q35 memory: 16384 meta: creation-qemu=7.2.0,ctime=1680232192 name: ubuntu net0: virtio=1E:05:6A:E7:68:85,bridge=vmbr2,tag=60 numa: 0 ostype: l26 scsi0: local-lvm:vm-102-disk-0,cache=writeback,discard=on,iothread=1,size=8&gt;scsihw: virtio-scsi-single smbios1: uuid=7b2a286b-197d-4382-9c04-5a0544596b89 sockets: 1 startup: order=4,up=30,down=30 usb0: host=24f0:0142 usb1: host=045e:0724 vga: none vmgenid: e93460b1-66f7-4694-a528-98ed006eb770 Ubuntu Server agent: 1 balloon: 0 boot: order=scsi0;ide2;net0 cores: 4 cpu: host ide2: none,media=cdrom memory: 8192 meta: creation-qemu=7.2.0,ctime=1680232488 name: ubuntu-server net0: virtio=F6:BF:85:17:B6:0F,bridge=vmbr2,firewall=1,tag=60 numa: 0 ostype: l26 scsi0: local-lvm:vm-103-disk-0,cache=unsafe,discard=on,iothread=1,size=32G scsihw: virtio-scsi-single smbios1: uuid=7bc4309c-dc9a-4632-bfd5-2e5f8a5e4fcd sockets: 1 startup: order=3,up=30,down=30 vmgenid: 2500d141-f7be-4c7b-ab9f-0a0f0075ea97 TrueNAS agent: 1 balloon: 0 boot: order=scsi0;ide2;net0 cores: 4 cpu: host ide2: none,media=cdrom machine: q35 memory: 8192 meta: creation-qemu=7.2.0,ctime=1680314889 name: truenas net0: virtio=DE:16:B3:D8:6C:C7,bridge=vmbr2,firewall=1,tag=60 numa: 0 ostype: l26 scsi0: local-lvm:vm-104-disk-0,discard=on,iothread=1,size=32G,ssd=1 scsi1: evo:vm-104-disk-0,discard=on,iothread=1,size=1000G,ssd=1 scsihw: virtio-scsi-single smbios1: uuid=2ab225ac-44d8-4fb0-b5eb-0ada70e05f33 sockets: 1 startup: order=2,up=30,down=30 vmgenid: 79db20a3-ff24-457c-8abb-6dc4df3c6e38 Windows 10 agent: 1 balloon: 0 bios: ovmf boot: order=ide0;ide2;scsi0;net0 cores: 8 cpu: host efidisk0: local-lvm:vm-105-disk-0,efitype=4m,pre-enrolled-keys=1,size=4M hostpci0: 0000:00:02,pcie=1 hostpci1: 0000:00:12,pcie=1 hostpci2: 0000:00:1f ide0: none,media=cdrom ide2: none,media=cdrom machine: pc-q35-7.2 memory: 32768 meta: creation-qemu=7.2.0,ctime=1680459394 name: windows-10 net0: virtio=72:B4:A4:CD:C6:96,bridge=vmbr2,firewall=1,tag=60 net1: virtio=C6:9F:2F:F2:73:7B,bridge=vmbr1,firewall=1,link_down=1 numa: 0 ostype: win10 scsi0: local-lvm:vm-105-disk-1,cache=unsafe,discard=on,iothread=1,size=150G&gt;scsihw: virtio-scsi-single smbios1: uuid=74ff8b62-d60d-4d5c-81a0-e3939baa380c sockets: 1 startup: order=4,up=30,down=30 vga: none vmgenid: f4593d16-12ab-4483-8962-6c27ee576f05 Join the conversation Over the last few weeks I built a lower power, efficient, and silent Proxmox server!

This is a beginner tutorial for Terraform and by the end of this, you will feel like an expert! 📺 Watch Video What is Terraform and how does it help? Terraform is a powerful infrastructure as code tool to help you create and manage infrastructure across multiple public or private clouds. It can help you provision, configure, and manage infrastructure using their simple and human readable configuration language. Using Terraform helps you automate your infrastructure and your DevOps workflow, do it consistently, and allows you to collaborate with teams in Git. There are 7 key areas where Terraform shines: Automation: Terraform enables automation of infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management, which reduces human error and saves time. Consistency: Terraform ensures that your infrastructure is consistent across all environments, from development to production. Collaboration: Terraform allows multiple teams to work together on infrastructure changes, using version control systems like Git. Cloud-agnostic: Terraform supports various cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, allowing you to use the same tool to manage resources across different clouds. Scalability: Terraform is designed to handle large-scale infrastructure deployments and can easily manage thousands of resources. Reusability: Terraform modules enable you to reuse code and infrastructure components across multiple projects, making it easier to manage infrastructure at scale. Flexibility: Terraform is highly flexible and can be extended through plugins to integrate with other tools and services. Installing Terraform This will work on Ubuntu and Windows + WSL Install terraform for other platforms Install dependencies sudo apt update sudo apt install software-properties-common gnupg2 curl Import the gpg key curl https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor &gt; hashicorp.gpg sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 hashicorp.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ Add hashicorp repository sudo apt-add-repository \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main\" Install terraform sudo apt install terraform Check the version terraform --version Terraform v1.4.0 on linux_amd64 Create your Terraform Cloudflare config First create a simple terraform config: terraform { required_providers { cloudflare = { source = \"cloudflare/cloudflare\" version = \"~&gt; 3.0\" } } } provider \"cloudflare\" { api_token = var.cloudflare_api_token } # Create a record resource \"cloudflare_record\" \"www\" { # ... } # Create a page rule resource \"cloudflare_page_rule\" \"www\" { # ... } Here is my .editorconfig: # http://editorconfig.org root = true [*] indent_style = space indent_size = 2 charset = utf-8 trim_trailing_whitespace = true insert_final_newline = true [*.md] trim_trailing_whitespace = false Initialize terraform and Cloudflare terraform init We should see that it installed plugins, and it should have created a lock file. Terraform Plan and Apply Next we’ll want to review our plan, we can see our proposed changes terraform plan Next we’ll apply our changes. terraform apply Verify on the dashboard. After applying we can verify the results. we can also test with nslookup nslookup yoursite.example.com Check Cloudflare’s site. if we run plan again, we can see there’s no work to do terraform apply Should see that there isn’t any work to do. Importing Cloudflare State We will need to import our Cloudflare state into our local Terraform state. An important point to understand about Terraform is that it can only manage configuration it created or was explicitly told about after the fact. The reason for this limitation is that Terraform expects to be authoritative for the resources it manages. It relies on two types of files to understand what resources it controls and what state they are in. Terraform determines when and how to make changes from the following: A configuration file (ending in .tf) that defines the configuration of resources for Terraform to manage. This is what you worked with in the tutorial steps. A local state file that maps the resource names defined in your configuration file — for example, cloudflare_load_balancer.www-lb — to the resources that exist in Cloudflare. https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/advanced-topics/import-cloudflare-resources/ So this means that we need to sync the remote state of Cloudflare, down to our local state. This is where cf-terraforming can help Check for the latest version here: https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming/tags Update this command with the latest tag curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming/releases/download/v0.11.0/cf-terraforming_0.11.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -o cf-terraforming.tar.gz tar -xzf cf-terraforming.tar.gz rm cf-terraforming.tar.gz sudo mv ./cf-terraforming /usr/local/bin sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cf-terraforming Then we need to updated our .zshrc or .bashrc with our variables nano ~/.zshrc export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN='12345' export CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID='abcde' The source your shell source ~/.zshrc Now let’s export Cloudflare state (Be sure you have copied your variables into your shell, or ran the export commands above ) cf-terraforming generate \\ --resource-type \"cloudflare_record\" \\ --zone $CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID &gt; imported.tf Look at the file and copy the contents into your cloudflare.tf then run terraform plan Terraform thinks that we need to apply all of these resources, even though they exist. We need to import them into our local state. cf-terraforming import \\ --resource-type \"cloudflare_record\" \\ --zone $CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID This will export a lot of commands, we now need to run them to import them into our state. All you need to do it copy and paste the commands into your terminal. This will import your local state, you can see it in terraform.tfstate If we run terraform plan now, we can see that there aren’t any changes. Remote State with Terraform Cloud Terraform Cloud Be sure to sign up for an account and then get add your CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN and an ENV variable in Terraform Cloud.Mark it as seneitive. Then you’ll want to updated your cloudflare.tf It should look like this cloud { hostname = \"app.terraform.io\" organization = \"your org\" workspaces { name = \"Cloudflare\" } } Your cloudflare.tf file should now look like: terraform { cloud { hostname = \"app.terraform.io\" organization = \"your org\" workspaces { name = \"Cloudflare\" } } required_providers { cloudflare = { source = \"cloudflare/cloudflare\" version = \"~&gt; 3.0\" } } } provider \"cloudflare\" { api_token = var.cloudflare_api_token } # Create a record resource \"cloudflare_record\" \"www\" { # ... } # Create a page rule resource \"cloudflare_page_rule\" \"www\" { # ... } Then run terraform init This will prompt you to sign in and then import your local state into Terraform cloud. CI / CD with GitHub Actions If you want to create a CI / CD pipeline with GitHub actions, you’ll need to create a new repo at GitHub Here is my .gitignore .terraform/ terraform.tfstate* Convert your local folder into a git repo: first, cd into your folder Note: Be sure not to commit any of your secrets to git! This includes API tokens, terraform state, and any other files that might include sensitive information git init git commit -m \"first commit\" git branch -M main git remote add origin git@github.com:username/your-repo-name.git git push -u origin main To create a branch, add files, commit, and push git checkout -b my-new-branch git add . git commit -m \"fix(terraform): made some changes\" git push --set-upstream origin my-new-branch Be sure you have created a secret TF_API_TOKEN with your Terraform API token. For reference, here is the terraform GitHub Action (with my bug fix) name: 'Terraform' on: push: branches: [ \"main\" ] pull_request: permissions: contents: read jobs: terraform: name: 'Terraform' runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: production # Use the Bash shell regardless whether the GitHub Actions runner is ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, or windows-latest defaults: run: shell: bash steps: # Checkout the repository to the GitHub Actions runner - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Install the latest version of Terraform CLI and configure the Terraform CLI configuration file with a Terraform Cloud user API token - name: Setup Terraform uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2 with: cli_config_credentials_token: $ # Initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory by creating initial files, loading any remote state, downloading modules, etc. - name: Terraform Init run: terraform init # Checks that all Terraform configuration files adhere to a canonical format - name: Terraform Format run: terraform fmt -check # Generates an execution plan for Terraform - name: Terraform Plan run: terraform plan -input=false # On push to \"main\", build or change infrastructure according to Terraform configuration files # Note: It is recommended to set up a required \"strict\" status check in your repository for \"Terraform Cloud\".

If you’re not familiar with encrypting your secrets with SOPS and Age, I highly recommend checking out a post I did a while back that shows you how easy it is to encrypt your secrets and even hide them in plain sight in a Git repo.I am happy (and relieved) that I started doing this for all of my secrets. This works great, until you need to rotate your encryption key that’s used to encrypt your secrets. I use FLUX for GitOps which helps me deliver changes to my Kubernetes cluster via code and since I can commit my infrastructure, I can also commit my secrets as code too (SOPS, or Secrets Operations).This means that all of my secret files (typically secret.sops.yaml) are all encrypted using my key.But what happens when I need to change the key, either for good security hygiene or because it was compromised? The short answer is, there’s no easy way other than writing a little bit of code. Scripting it with Bash First you’ll need to generate a new age file with age-keygen -o age.agekey This will output a age.agekey file.Take note of this location. Then you’ll want to execute this script in the folder where you have secrets that need to be updated. This script isn’t anything ground breaking but hopefully it will help you update all of your secrets without having to go and manually change them yourself. #!/bin/bash # Define the paths to the old/current and new age key files SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE_NEW=~/.config/sops/age/age.agekey # Define the commands to decrypt and encrypt the file DECRYPT_COMMAND=\"sops --decrypt --age \\$(cat $SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE |grep -oP \\\"public key: \\K(.*)\\\") --encrypted-regex '^(data|stringData)$' --in-place\" ENCRYPT_COMMAND=\"sops --encrypt --age \\$(cat $SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE_NEW |grep -oP \\\"public key: \\K(.*)\\\") --encrypted-regex '^(data|stringData)$' --in-place\" # Find all the *.sops.yaml files recursively in the current directory and apply the decrypt and encrypt commands to them find . -name \"*.sops.yaml\" -type f -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do eval \"$DECRYPT_COMMAND $file\" eval \"$ENCRYPT_COMMAND $file\" done It works like this: SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE is the path to your existing keys.txt or age.agekey file SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE_NEW is the path to your new age.agekey file. It will look for files matching *.sops.yaml recursively and then decrypt the file using the old key, and encrypt it using the new key. After running this script you should see all of your secrets now encrypted with the new key! You can now replace your old key file with your new one so that SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE is referencing. You should test decrypting your secrets before saving them. sops --decrypt --age $(cat $SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE |grep -oP \"public key: \\K(.*)\") --encrypted-regex '^(data|stringData)$' secret.sops.yaml Updating your FLUX Secret in Kubernetes If you are able to see the decrypted secret, you are all set as far as the ket goes.Another thing you’ll need to do is delete your old secret in Kubernetes and replace it with this new one so that your secrets can be decrypted in your cluster! kubectl delete -n flux-system secrets sops-age Then create new secret from the new file cat age.agekey | kubectl create secret generic sops-age \\ --namespace=flux-system \\ --from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin Now you should be all set! Be sure to keep your new age.agekey somewhere safe. Join the conversation I wrote up a quick post on how to rotate your SOPS encryption key and update all of your secrets at once!

Today we’re going to cover setting up VLANs using UniFi’s network controller.We’ll set up a VLAN, from start to finish, which includes creating a new network, configuring a wireless network that uses VLANs, and then we’ll set up firewall rules to make sure we’re keeping our network safe. If you think VLANs are only for the enterprise, you’re wrong, I will show you how they are helpful at home too. 📺 Watch Video So what’s a VLAN? A VLAN or Virtual Local Area Networks, is a group of devices, computers, or servers that communicate with each other as if they are on the same physical LAN, but they are actually located on separate physical LAN segments.VLANs can be created by configuring a managed network switch to segment the network into different broadcast domains. So why are VLANs important, even to the home user? VLANs are important for security. They can help isolate sensitive data and systems from the rest of your network, improving security by preventing unauthorized access. VLANs are important for performance. VLANs can be used to separate network traffic into different segments, reducing network congestion and improving overall performance. VLANS are important for management. VLANS can be used to simplify network management by grouping devices based on location, department, or even function making it much easier to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot. VLANs give you flexibility. VLANS allow for network changes and reconfigurations without physical changes to your network infrastructure saving you time and money, and we all want to save that, right? So what’s not to love about VLANs if they give you greater control over network traffic, help optimize network performance, give you better security, and give you management and flexibility? Well, for me it was complexity and knowing where to start. Hardware Ubiquiti UniFi 6 Lite Access Point - https://l.technotim.com/ubiquiti UniFI UDM SE - https://l.technotim.com/ubiquiti UniFi UDM Pro - https://l.technotim.com/ubiquiti (Affiliate links are included in this description. I may receive a small commission at no cost to you.) How to Create a VLAN with UniFi A list of common VLANs in UniFi Network Application Navigate Settings Choose Networks Choose “Create New Network” Name it whatever we like (IoT) Choose something descriptive Choose your router (if applicable), but I wouldn’t offload routing unless you know what you’re doing. I typically uncheck auto scale network and define it myself We’ll choose the host address and netmask While we’re at it we should also choose manual for the advanced section Choose a VLAN Id I typically match the 3rd octet in my case that would be 100 If you’re using Apple devices or Chromecast (or similar devices) on this network, you’ll want to turn on IGMP snooping &amp; Multicast DNS DHCP Mode - you’ll want to keep as DHCP server For DHCP Range you’ll want to choose the beginning and end of your range.Can be anything within range.At home I usually start at 100 so I know which devices are using DHCP at a glance. There are other options here that you don’t really need to change but if you do, change them to your liking Congrats you just created your first VLAN! 🎉 Creating Wireless Network for a VLAN A list of common WiFI networks in UniFi Network Application Once we’ve created our VLAN, we can now add this to a wireless network.This is perfect for IoT devices or really any VLAN that you want to use over your wireless network. First, we’ll go to Settings, then WiFi Then choose create new WiFi Network We’ll name the network and give it a password Then we’ll choose the Network it belongs to (IoT) In the network list we can see our newly created network! You can make any other adjustments you need to your wireless network, but I am going to keep the defaults. Then we’ll hit apply If you check your access points, you can now see this wireless network being set up and provisioned with the new config that contains our new WiFi network that is bound to our VLAN! Assigning a VLAN to a Switch port UniFi Network application port management You can now assign this to one of your switch post by going into your switch and assigning it this VLAN / VLAN ID Choose the new VLAN and let your device get a new DHCP address from the new VLAN. You should expect to see an IP in the range that we set above. Once you choose once we assign it, let’s connect a device and test it out. Connect a device, check its IP, ping google, then ping another device on another VLAN.Uh-oh! UniFi allows inter VLAN communication out of the box.I guess this was a conscious decision from them to make things easier, but it does make your networks open to other networks. We can fix that, with a firewall rule! Configuring a Network Profile A list of common WiFI networks in UniFi Network Application Before we set up our firewall rules, first let’s create a profile.Profiles are a simple way to group items or alias them.This comes in handy later when creating firewall rules. Navigate to Profiles Create a new Profile Name it something like “(VLAN NAME) Only” Set type to IPv4 Address/Subnet Add all of your other VLANs 192.168.0.0/24 (this is the default network) 192.168.10.0/24 (this is my “Trusted” network) Again, this Profile is for all other VLANs, not our new VLAN we just created. Configuring Firewall Rule In order to block inter VLAN Communication we’ll need to set up some firewall rules.The pattern I usually follow is blocking all traffic from one VLAN destined to all other VLANs.This can be done by creating Profiles. Navigate to Firewall &amp; Security Choose the Type For inter VLAN communication you’ll want to choose “LAN In” Give your Rule a description, I usually follow the convention Block thing to other thing e.g. Block IoT to ALL Be sure this applies before predefined rules for Action, choose “Drop” For Source Type, Choose “Network” For Network choose your new VLAN e.g. “IoT” For Destination choose “Port/IP Group” For IPv4 Address Group choose “IoT Only” (this is the Profile we created above) For Port Group choose “Any” This rule will block all communication that that originates on your IoT VLAN to all other VLANs (IoT Only). You’ll also want to be sure that this rule applies after every rule that you want to allow in your list of Firewall rules. Navigate to Firewall &amp; Security Check rule order Be sure that any rule you create that Allows / Accepts is above this rule that Blocks / Denies. Testing Be sure to test all of your firewall rules! Once you have these rules in place, I highly recommend you test your firewall rules.Some examples of things you should test Can you communicate with the IoT VLAN from your Trusted VLAN? Can you communicate with the Trusted VLAN from your IoT VLAN? Can you communicate with the gateway (192.168.100.1) from your IoT VLAN? Can you communicate with DNS from your IoT VLAN? Checking these types of things will help you verify that your network rules are being applied properly.Repeat these tests anytime you make changes. Wrapping up At this point you should have a new VLAN that works on your WiFi access points, your network ports, and should have firewall rules in place to prevent unauthorized access! You can simply repeat this process for every new VLAN that you need! Have you set up VLANs yet? Join the conversation Today I decided to share how I set up my VLANs, Firewall rules, Wireless Networks, and Network Security. 👉https://t.co/SOGBrsmKXK#vlan #unifi #homelab pic.twitter.com/x2LovlQVd4&mdash; Techno Tim (@TechnoTimLive) March 4, 2023 Links 🛍️ Check out the new Merch Shop at https://l.technotim.com/shop ⚙️ See all the hardware I recommend at https://l.technotim.com/gear 🚀 Don’t forget to check out the 🚀Launchpad repo with all of the quick start source files" }, { "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Wake on LAN for Windows, MacOS, and Linux", "url": "/posts/wake-on-lan/", "categories": "utilities", "tags": "wol, windows, mac, linux, network, network, wake-on-lan", "date": "2023-02-19 09:00:00 -0600", "content": "What is Wake on LAN and why is it so hard? After releasing my video on the PiKVM I realized that there was so much confusion about Wake on LAN, and rightfully so, that I decided to put together this guide on how to configure Wake on LAN on any machine. Wake on LAN (WoL) is a networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on by sending a network packet. The client sends a special packet (sometimes referred to as a “magic packet”) and the remote machine will wake up either from a cold power state or from sleep.This is where it starts to get complicated because different hardware manufactures have implemented different controls in BIOS to enable or disable this, and to make even more complex operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux have also implemented their own way to wake the machine up when it’s sleeping or in a low powered state.I am just going to throw this out there, Wake on LAN is hard.Since there are many different combinations I will try to cover how to configure your machines wake up successfully regardless of hardware, operating system, and power state. Preparing your hardware for Wake on LAN In order to wake your machine up, we have to be sure that WoL features are turned on in the BIOS and that other features are disabled.Since I cannot test every single BIOS out there, I am going to use my machine as an example for the types of options you will need to enable or disable.Most of the options should be named similarly however where it is located in your BIOS will depend on your manufacturer. First, you’ll need to get into the BIOS of the machine, this is typically done by pressing a key at book like f2 or del but varies by machine. Once you’re in you’re in we’ll start changing some settings. Power settings You’ll want to look around for something similar to power settings.If you do not see these options in your power settings, it could be in advanced, networking, or onboard devices. Power settings menu for Intel NUC.This will look different for your machine but the idea is still the same Here are some things to look for: Deep S4/S5 Sleep - You’ll want to disable this, otherwise only the power button will wake the machine which will disable Wake on LAN Wake on LAN from S4/S5 - You’ll want to enable this setting and if it has an option choose Power on - Normal Boot Wake System from S5 - You’ll want to disable this.This is basically an alarm clock for your machine.There’s no need to enable this unless you want set a time for it to turn on every day.I’ve used this in the past as a contingency plan for some of my servers in case they were powered off accidentally. I would set an alarm for 12 AM. USB S4/S5 Power - I typically disable this if it’s a server since nothing should be plugged in but if it’s a desktop with USB devices you want powered you can turn it on safely. Wake on LAN - enable this might sound obvious but some older systems have an option that says exactly that however newer systems have options for waking in all of the different sleep states. What to do when AC Power is restored - This is optional but I usually set it to Stay Off if it’s a desktop, Power On if it’s a server that should always be on, and Last power state if it’s something like a machine that I wake seldomly.There is one exception, which is if you have a way to toggle the power remotely too.I have a USP PDU Pro from UniFi that I can toggle all of my servers on and off.If you are able to toggle them on and off, the best setting is Power On, that way you have a way to power them on, even if they were gracefully shut down previously. Another quick check you can do is power down the machine and check to be sure the network light is lit up on your NIC.If it’s not, this means Wake on LAN is not enabled on your machine and you’ll have to find the option in your BIOS to make it work. Bare Metal Wake up If you don’t have an operating system on your machine yet, you should be able to wake up the machine over the network now.If you do have an operating system on your machine, another way you can test a bare metal / cold boot wake is by pulling the power on the machine and then plugging it back in.The reason this should work is because modern operating systems might not fully shut down (they go into a sort of sleep) or might disable WoL on the NIC when shutting down.We’ll fix this in the next section. Waking up a Windows machine After you enabled Wake on LAN in the BIOS, and verified you see the light on your NIC blinking when you power off your machine, we can now enable Wake on LAN at the operating system level for Windows.This will work on all modern versions of Windows (Windows 10 and Windows 11). Device manager First we’ll want to open the Device Manager.You can do this from the UI or from a command prompt devmgmt.msc Be sure to select the network card that you use to connect to your network. Once open you’ll want to expand Network adapters and find your network adapter, then right click and choose Properties Then choose the Power Management tab and be sure that all of these options are enabled Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power Allow this device to wake the computer Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer. Power Management options for your network adapter. Then we’ll need to verify a few more settings.These settings may or may not exist and depend on your network adapter manufacturer. Click on the Advanced Tab for your Network Adapter Find Wake on Magic Packet and set it to Enabled Find WOL &amp; Shutdown Link Speed and set it to 10 Mbps You’ll want to be sure that your switch supports this speed, otherwise Auto should be fine Click OK You should check to see if Wake on LAN works before proceeding to the next step since this might not be necessary with your machine. Fast Startup Another Windows Feature that can prevent a machine from shutting down properly to allow Wake on LAN is Fast Startup.This disables hibernation.I recommend testing to see if Wake on LAN works before disabling this. First, we’ll need to open the Power Control Panel.You can do this from the UI or from a command prompt powercfg.cpl Then we’ll need to change some settings Click Choose what the power buttons do from the left menu Click Change settings that are currently unavailable Uncheck Turn on fast startup (recommended) Click Save changes You should now check to see if Wake on LAN works for your machine. Waking up a Linux machine After you enable Wake on LAN in the BIOS, and verified you see the light on your NIC blinking when you power off your machine, we can now enable Wake on LAN at the operating system level for Linux.This sounds odd but I have found that machines (especially Linux) need WoL turned on for each NIC. Install ethtool if you don’t have it already sudo apt update sudo apt install ethtool First check to see if WoL is supported by your NIC ip a # this will list all of your NICs sudo ethtool eno1 # replace with one of the NICs you want to check This should output something similar to Settings for eno1: Supported ports: [ TP ] Supported link modes: 10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full 1000baseT/Full Supported pause frame use: No Supports auto-negotiation: Yes Supported FEC modes: Not reported Advertised link modes: 10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full 1000baseT/Full Advertised pause frame use: No Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes Advertised FEC modes: Not reported Speed: 1000Mb/s Duplex: Full Auto-negotiation: on Port: Twisted Pair PHYAD: 1 Transceiver: internal MDI-X: on (auto) Supports Wake-on: pumbg Wake-on: g Current message level: 0x00000007 (7) drv probe link Link detected: yes You’re looking for Supports Wake-on: pumbg with at least the letter g in the string.This means that the NIC does support WoL for a magic packet, which is a good thing.If you don’t see this here, don’t worry we’ll fix it in netplan Using Netplan There are lots of outdated commands you’ll find on the internet that won’t work or will partially work so I advise that you only do this with netplan.If you don’t have netplan installed (Debian, etc…) skip to the next section. To edit your netplan sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml # replace with your netplan yaml Once here, you’ll see your network settings.You’ll want to turn on wakeonlan in this yaml for each NIC.For example if you have 2 NICs, eno1 and enp2s0 you would add it in both places under that key. # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system # For more information, see netplan(5). network: version: 2 renderer: networkd ethernets: eno1: dhcp4: yes wakeonlan: true enp2s0: dhcp4: yes wakeonlan: true Once this is set, you’ll want to apply your netplan. sudo netplan apply Then we’ll want to shutdown sudo shutdown -P now Now we should be able to wake up the machine using WoL from a remote machine. Without Netplan (Debian, etc…) Since you don’t have netplan we’ll have to create a service and enable it.Do not do this step if you configure it with netplan. Find the path to ethtool which ethtool In my case it’s at /usr/sbin/ethtool but your may vary. Nest we’ll create a file at /etc/systemd/system/wol.service nano /etc/systemd/system/wol.service In this file add the following [Unit] Description=Enable Wake On LAN [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart = /usr/sbin/ethtool --change eno1 wol g [Install] WantedBy=basic.target You’ll want to be sure to change your path for ethtool as well eno1 to the name of your NIC Then we’ll need to enable the service sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable wol.service Then we can check to be sure out service is started systemctl status wol Then we’ll want to shutdown sudo shutdown -P now Now we should be able to wake up the machine using WoL from a remote machine. Waking up a Mac Waking up a Mac is pretty easy, the easiest of them all.The most challenging part is finding the option in System Preferences. For a Macbook: Open System Preferences and search for power Click on Power Nap in Battery You’ll see Wake for network access here you can choose whether you want to wake up Always or Only on Power Adapter.Either of these options should be fine. For all other Macs you’ll want to search System Preferences for another option. Search for “Energy Saver” Here you’ll see an option to Wake for network access.Be sure this is check This option might appear different in different versions of macOS and it also varies by form factor, but you’ll want to be sure that the “Wake for network access” option is turned on Installing a Wake on LAN client In order to wake up a remote machine machine up, you will need a tool that can send a wake on LAN packet to the remote machine. Windows Wake On LAN CLient I am a fan of doing this in a terminal however a decent Windows utility with a GUI is WakeOnLAN.It’s also open source and hosted on GitHub.After installing it and configuring a machine to wake you should be able to wake your machine if it is on the same network and you’ve followed the other steps that are outlined in this guide. WakeOnLAN is an open source Windows utility that has a nice GUI Linux Wake on LAN client I usually prefer installing a command line tool to wake machines up over the network from a Linux machine and I typically using wakeonlan an open source utility that’s simple to use. To install it on a Debian-like system: sudo apt update sudo apt install wakeonlan Once it’s installed you can now wake machines on the same network by using the command: sudo wakeonlan 00:11:22:33:44:55 If your machine is on another network and you can reach the broadcast IP, you can supply it in your command sudo wakeonlan -i 192.168.2.255 00:11:22:33:44:55 Be sure to replace the mac address and broadcast IP above with the mac address of the remote machine and set the broadcast IP if on a different network. macOS Wake on LAN client To instal a client for macOS it’s very simple using brew brew install wakeonlan Once it’s installed you can now wake machines on the same network by using the command: wakeonlan 00:11:22:33:44:55 If your machine is on another network and you can reach the broadcast IP, you can supply it in your command wakeonlan -i 192.168.2.255 00:11:22:33:44:55 Be sure to replace the mac address and broadcast IP above with the mac address of the remote machine and set the broadcast IP if on a different network. Wrapping up At this point you should be able to power on any machine from any machine on your network. One piece of advice is if you are using VLANs you’ll want to b sure you are sending the WoL packet from the same network, otherwise you’ll have to be sure that you can reach and target the right broadcast IP from the network you are on.As I mentioned in the beginning of this post, Wake on LAN is hard however if you follow these steps for each machine type you should be able to enjoy reliably waking up your machine remotely over the network.

What is the PiKVM? If you don’t know what a KVM switch is, it’s a device that allows you to connect multiple computers to one device which allows you to control them with a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse.They’re relatively cheap unless you’re looking for an IP based one that will let you connect over the network.IP KVMs are really expensive, that is until the PiKVM came along. The PiKVM is a Raspberry Pi-based KVM switch, which allows you to remotely control a computer using a keyboard, a web browser, and mouse from anywhere in the world.It runs a web server that lets you connect to any computer connected to it and remote control it as if you’re sitting right in front of it, without plugins or installing any agents on the device. It’s much more capable than remote controlling it using a remote desktop client, it can even let you remote control a machine before it boots to let you change things in the bios, or even reformat and reinstall your operating system remotely. This is all great except for one small thing, unlike a traditional KVM that lets you control multiple devices, the PiKVM is really meant for remote controlling just one device.The PiKVM is built with just one HDMI input and one keyboard mouse input while traditional KVMs have multiple inputs for multiple clients.So how can we scale the PiKVM to connect it to more devices so that we aren’t stuck moving it from machine to machine each time we need to remote control one of our other devices? 📺 Watch Video The little LCD is both cute and functional You can build a PiKVM yourself by purchasing the PiKVM v3 HAT which is a great choice if you already have a raspberry pi4 and are willing to build it yourself.Or if you have a Pi Zero you can even build it using some inexpensive parts and without soldering.But chances are you have neither since raspberry pis are impossible to find and buying a pre-assembled kit is the only option.It was for me and that’s what I ended up doing.I purchased the PiKVM v3 pre-assembled which comes with a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB model, 32GB micro SD card, power supply, an HDMI cable, a USB C to USB A cable, and a nice case.The steel case is solid and feels sturdy and industrial.The PiKVM has lots of connections, connections for power, USB devices, mouse and keyboard emulation, RJ45 to serial connection, HDMI, and even an RJ45 connector for ATX power which lets me hook this up to a motherboard to power it on and off remotely.The other cool thing you get with the pre-assembled kit is the little LCD screen that shows system information and a cute cat when it boots. It comes pre-flashed with PiKVM installed and ready to go. Oh, it runs arch BTW. I had to let you know Sponsor A HUGE THANKS to Micro Center for sponsoring today’s content.

Well, I wanted to connect it to 8x times that, yes 8 devices.I found this HDMI KVM switcher with a USB hub that I thought would be perfect for it. This TESmart allows you to connect up to 8 devices with video and USB and has a built-in USB hub.It also has an RJ45 port that allows me to change the input over IP and that’s it. It’s not an IP KVM otherwise I would need the PiKVM, but being able to switch the input over IP is all I needed to automate it with the PiKVM.I thought this device was perfect for remote controlling some of my servers considering it is rack mountable.However there was just one catch that would almost ruin this entire project that I didn’t know about yet. The Problems Ahead I tested PiKVM on my workbench with this old intel NUC and it worked fine.I was able to remote control it and even power it on and off using Wake on LAN.I chalked it up as a success and started moving everything into my server rack.It might not seem like it, but mounting this HDMI KVM Switch took quite some time.I had to run HDMI cables and USB B cables to and from all of my devices that I wanted to remote control.I started running the wires and wiring up 4 devices, just to be sure it worked with my existing machines before wiring up all 8.But, I bet you’re asking why I just don’t use IPMI that I have on my servers? Well, this isn’t to control my servers, it’s to control my rack mounted PC conversion along my new Intel NUC cluster.None of these machines have IPMI so that’s why I needed an IP KVM solution like the PiKVM. I decided to put my PiKVM on this little shelf for now but I’ll probably find somewhere a little more permanent to place it. Once I had everything hooked up, that’s when the troubles began.I could remote into some of the NUCs running Linux and the PC conversion, but not the ones running Windows.I thought for sure that it was something with my connection so I checked all of the connections over and over again.It was right around that time that the creator of PiKVM Max Devaev reach out to me asking me how I was liking the PiKVM and to let him know if I ran into any troubles because he was interested in advanced use cases for the PiKVM.I’m not sure why he thought I was going to be using this in an advanced way…. But he was right… This was my first attempt with a TESmart Switch I worked with Max for a few days on and off over discord.He sent snippets of code for me to run and even gave me lots of EDIDs to try. EDIDs (Extended Display Identification Data) are a signature or metadata that tell a device how to work with the monitor.Sometimes we could get the Linux machines running on the TESmart switch working, but not the Windows machines. And other times we could get the Windows machines working but not the Linux machines.We ended up discovering that the TESmart HDMI switch would “poison” the PiKVM and send the TESmart EDID rather than the one from the PiKVM. TESmart EDID: Section \"Monitor\" Identifier \"ITE-FHD\" ModelName \"ITE-FHD\" VendorName \"ITE\" # Monitor Manufactured week 12 of 2010 # EDID version 1.3 # Digital Display DisplaySize 620 340 Gamma 2.20 Option \"DPMS\" \"false\" Horizsync 13-46 VertRefresh 23-61 # Maximum pixel clock is 170MHz PiKVM EDID Section \"Monitor\" Identifier \"PiKVM\" ModelName \"PiKVM\" VendorName \"LNX\" # Monitor Manufactured week 28 of 2011 # EDID version 1.3 # Digital Display # Display Physical Size not given.

Gamma 2.20 Option \"DPMS\" \"false\" Horizsync 15-46 VertRefresh 59-61 # Maximum pixel clock is 150MHz #Not giving standard mode: 256x160, 60Hz At this point, I had to cut my losses and go with a smaller, non rack mountable, but more compatible EZCOO KVM Switch and, I have to say, it’s fantastic. A New HDMI Switch Enters the Chat This is the EZCoo HDMI KVM switch. It’s a 4 port HDMI KVM Switch that allows 4 HDMI ports to be switched to a single display. This single display will be the PiKVM.It also has a built- in USB 3 hub which is awesome for plugging in USB devices that will connect to the machine when you switch the input.It has 4 HDMI inputs and 1 USB 3 input that you’ll connect to each machine and has one HDMI out and one USB for keyboard and one for mouse.We won’t be using these specific USB ports because we’ll be using mouse &amp; keyboard emulation in one plugged into a generic USB port. The real magic of this device is that it has a micro USB management port on the side that the PiKVM can use to control and toggle the inputs automatically, giving us a way to switch between all of our connected devices without having to manually press the input button.As nice as this device is, I really wish they made an 8 port rack mountable one because I want to control more than 4 devices without swapping them out or daisy chaining them, Which is why I wanted the TESmart switch in the first place. Oh, speaking of the TESmart, after working with Max for a while on this device he mentioned that this might work with the new v4 version of the PiKVM which just recently launched on Kickstarter.He said he was going to send one of their prototypes to test so, fingers crossed it works.I will be sure to create a v4 video once it’s released and hopefully it supports the TESmart switch. This EZCOO is small, compact, and 100% compatible Putting it all together Now that I had everything working the way it should it was time to connect to each device through the web portal.Once connected, I can toggle between each of my devices here, from my first Intel NUC running Ubuntu, to my Second Intel NUC running Windows 10, to my third Intel NUC running Windows 11, to my PC conversion running Ubuntu server.And you can see that it’s pretty snappy. The latency is really low and I can even run HD videos no problem at all.If I do run into any latency issues or I am on a slow connection I can change the protocol and even the bitrate to something more fitting. But running HD videos probably isn’t the reason you want a KVM, it’s more likely that you want to have access to the machine while it boots, and here’s where it gets really awesome. The PiKVM is open and it’s totally hackable and there are some great plugins and drivers that allow you to customize the UI with those plugins. For instance I can shutdown this machine and then wake it up using a Wake on LAN packet to power it back on.Side note, I learned a ton about making Wake on LAN work for Windows and Linux and I will be updating my blogs with complete walk-throughs of how to enable it, but anyway If that wasn’t cool enough I can then get into the BIOS of this machine to make any changes that I want.I can change the boot order, change boot devices, overclock the machine and do anything that I couldn’t normally do without being right in front of the machine.I can even upload ISOs to the PiKVM and then attach them to the device virtually and boot from it to install any operating system! This lets me rebuild any of these machines no matter where I am all from a web browser. Want to install Linux on a machine that’s powered off, no problem.Just attach the virtual drive to the machine, send a wake on lan packet to wake it up, then boot from the virtual drive and install! You could also attach the ATX power control to the header of the motherboard if you like and power it on that way, but I have network access to all of my machines so I will use wake on lan.Plus, it’s super awesome to be able to wake devices up over the network. And here’s where it gets really awesome, remember how I said that my KVM also has a USB Hub? Well, I’ve attached a 64GB USB drive to it with Ventoy installed that has every ISO I could ever need.As I switch inputs between machines it attaches the USB drive with Ventoy to each machine allowing me to install any operating system I want. You can make this even more powerful by adding a USB drive and Ventoy Because the PiKVM is hackable, I’ve customized the GPIO menu to let me switch between devices, wake them up, wake them up on different NICs, and restart the kvmd service or the PiKVM itself. (See my config below) I should say that I didn’t really “hack” it, this isn’t a “techno tim” hack - there’s an overrides file that lets you customize most of the PiKVM so I didn’t go totally off the rails.It even has a web ui to give you terminal access to your PiKVM in case you aren’t able to use SSH, which is super handy if you’re mobile. But this little device has so many features already and the fact that the software is open source and continues to be updated makes this solution such a great investment for me. You can customize the menu however you like (my config below), here I added WoL for each network card and even a way to restart the PiKVM from the menu Is it worth it? So I bet you’re wondering if it’s worth it? I am going to break this down into 2 parts.Is it worth it to buy pre assembled? And is it worth it for remote control with a PiKVM. Well for me it is for a few reasons.First of all I can’t find a raspberry pi to assemble this myself, and if you consider it comes with a case, a fan, a 32GB micro sd, additional cables, and even a little LCD screen 100% ready to go for an additional 90 bucks? I would say it is.Now on to the tougher question, is it worth it to have a PiKVM at all? I would say yes for me, but for you it depends.The way I looked at it was that I was going to scale it to 8, which would divide the cost of a PiKVM and switch across 8 machines making it around 70 dollars per machine if you include all of the cables. PiKVM $259 + TESmart $299 / 8 = $70 per machine I’d say that it’s worth it for me to have remote access to that many machines for the life of each machine.But, I did have to downgrade to a smaller switch that only gives me access to 4 machines which is roughly 95 dollars per machine. PiKVM $259 + EZCOO $120 / 4 = $95 per machine That’s a little bit higher, however it’s a much better value than remote controlling just one machine with the PiKVM, which would be the cost of the PiKVM. PiKVM $259 / 1 = $259 per machine Hardware Here are the items that I used during this project.

Nested Virtualization is a feature that allows you to run a virtual machine within a virtual machine while still using hardware acceleration from the host machine.Put simply, it allows you to run a vm inside of a vm. Enabling Nested Virtualization In Proxmox Everything we do will be done on the host system running Proxmox.Once enabled, the guest can take advantage of it. First we need to check to see if nested virtualization is enabled in Proxmox. If you’re running an Intel CPU run this command: cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested If you’re running an AMD CPU run this command: cat /sys/module/kvm_amd/parameters/nested You should see an output of Y or N.If N this means that nested virtualization is not enabled, so let’s enabled it! On the Proxmox host, run the following command as root: If you’re running an Intel CPU run this command: echo \"options kvm-intel nested=Y\" &gt; /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf If you’re running an AMD CPU run this command: echo \"options kvm-amd nested=1\" &gt; /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-amd.conf Next reboot the system reboot Then check to see if nexted virtualization is enabled on the Proxmox host: If you’re running an Intel CPU run this command: cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested If you’re running an AMD CPU run this command: cat /sys/module/kvm_amd/parameters/nested You should see Y this time.This means that you can now using virtualization inside of a VM, just be sure to set your VM’s processor accordingly!

Second, you’ll need to provision the VMs. Here’s an easy way to create perfect Proxmox templates with cloud image and cloud init and a video if you need. Next, you’ll need to fork and clone the repo.While you’re at it, give it a ⭐ too :). git clone https://github.com/timothystewart6/k3s-ansible Next you’ll want to create a local copy of ansible.example.cfg. cp ansible.example.cfg ansible.cfg You’ll want to adapt this to suit your needs however the defaults should work without issue.If you’re looking for the old defaults, you can see them in this PR that remove the file. Next you’ll need to install some requirements for ansible ansible-galaxy install -r ./collections/requirements.yml Next, you’ll want to cd into the repo and copy the sample directory within the inventory directory. (Be sure you’re using the latest template) cp -R inventory/sample inventory/my-cluster Installing k3s Next, edit the inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini to match your systems.DNS works here too.

It’s best to start using these args, and optionally include traefik if you want it installed with k3s however I would recommend installing it later with helm It’s best to start with the default values in the repo. # change these to your liking, the only required are: --disable servicelb, --tls-san extra_server_args: &gt;- {{ extra_args }} {{ '--node-taint node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true:NoSchedule' if k3s_master_taint else '' }} --tls-san {{ apiserver_endpoint }} --disable servicelb --disable traefik extra_agent_args: &gt;- {{ extra_args }} I would not change these values unless you know what you are doing.It will most likely not work for you but listing for posterity. Note: These are for an advanced use case. There isn’t a one size fits all setting for everyone and their needs, I would try using k3s with the above values before changing them.This could have undesired effects like nodes going offline, pods jumping or being removed, etc… Using these args might come at the cost of stability Also, these will not work anymore without some modifications extra_server_args: \"--disable servicelb --disable traefik --write-kubeconfig-mode 644 --kube-apiserver-arg default-not-ready-toleration-seconds=30 --kube-apiserver-arg default-unreachable-toleration-seconds=30 --kube-controller-arg node-monitor-period=20s --kube-controller-arg node-monitor-grace-period=20s --kubelet-arg node-status-update-frequency=5s\" extra_agent_args: \"--kubelet-arg node-status-update-frequency=5s\" Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command: ansible-playbook ./site.yml -i ./inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini Note: note: add –ask-pass –ask-become-pass if you are using password SSH login.

However, if you want to store your certificates on disk, this tutorial here is perfectly fine. It assumes you have followed: Fully Automated K3S etcd High Availability Install (or) HIGH AVAILABILITY k3s (Kubernetes) in minutes! (if you need rancher) High Availability Rancher on a Kubernetes Cluster There is a little bit of “undoing” we’ll have to do since k3s ships with traefik and Rancher doesn’t play well with service load balancer. So, we’ll pick up after instaling these two. Reconfigure Rancher Make note of your version of Rancher Remove Rancher helm uninstall rancher Install Rancher (replace with version above) helm install rancher rancher-stable/rancher \\ --namespace cattle-system \\ --set hostname=rancher.example.com \\ --version 2.5.6 Reconfiguring k3s Get the version of k3s that’s currently running k3s --version export INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.20.5+k3s1 Run the same command you ran initially to install k3s on your servers but add --disable traefik --disable servicelb and be sure to set your version. example (be sure you are using the right version) export INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.20.5+k3s1 curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server --node-taint CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute --tls-san your.load.balancer.ip --write-kubeconfig-mode 644 --disable traefik --disable servicelb This should reconfigure your servers.Just run it on all server nodes, not agent nodes. Install Metal LB Metal LB installation You can follow Self-Hosting Your Homelab Services with SSL to get the idea of Metal LB. It’s recommended to: Install with helm Use Layer2 configuration if you follow this series Exposing Rancher directly to your Metal LB It’s a good idea to do this until traefik is configured otherwise you won’t have access to the Rancher UI kubectl expose deployment rancher -n cattle-system --type=LoadBalancer --name=rancher-lb --port=443 Then, you can access Rancher UI after getting external-IP kubectl get service/rancher-lb -n cattle-system Install Traefik 2 You can can choose between creating Ingress in Rancher or IngresRoute with traefik If you choose IngressRoute see IngressRoute otherwise continue on. You must have a persistent volume set up already for acme.json certificate This uses cloudflare, check providers if you want to switch This will get wildcard certs This is pointed at staging, if you want production be sure comment staging the line (and delete your staging certs) We will be installing this into the kube-system namespace, which already exists. If you are going to use anther namespace you will need change it everywhere. (Optional) Make sure that persistent volume claim is available The dynamic configuration for Traefik is stored in a persistent volume. If you want to persist the certificate, it’s better to create one now to claim later. To create a persistent volume, it’s better to check out Cloud Native Distributed Storage in Kubernetes with Longhorn. If not, just create one from Rancher UI &gt; Clusters (Choose your cluster) &gt; Storage &gt; Persistent Volume &gt; Add volume Add traefik helm repo and update helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik helm repo update Edit &amp; apply ConfigMap Create traefik-config.yaml with the contents of /config/traefik-config.yaml from /config This holds our cloudflare secrets along with a configmap Update this file with your values Re-check if you have a persistent volume ready to claim Apply the config kubectl apply -f traefik-config.yaml Edit &amp; install Traefik helm chart Create traefik-chart-values.yaml with the contents of /config/traefik-chart-values.yaml from /config Update loadBalancerIP in traefik-chart-values.yaml with your Metal LB IP Before running this, be sure you only have one default storage class set. If you are using Rancher it is Cluster &gt; Storage &gt; Storage Classes. Make sure only one is default. Install Traefik with chart values helm install traefik traefik/traefik --namespace=kube-system --values=traefik-chart-values.yaml More configuration value can be add from this default-value.yaml from Traefik github. If all went well, you should now have traefik 2 installed and configured. Check for container logs To check if the Traefik instance is running correctly, see the logs: kubectl -n kube-system logs $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector \"app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik\" --output=name) It should be level=info msg=\"Configuration loaded from flags.\" Traefik Dashboard To see all router to Traefik, we can install and expose Traefik Dashboard. First you will need htpassword to generate a password for your dashboard. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install apache2-utils You can then generate one using this, be sure to swap your username and password. htpasswd -nb techno password | openssl base64 It should output: dGVjaG5vOiRhcHIxJFRnVVJ0N2E1JFpoTFFGeDRLMk8uYVNaVWNueG41eTAKCg== Save this in a secure place, it will be the password you use to access the traefik dashboard. Copy traefik-dashboard-secret.yaml locally and update it with your credentials. Copy traefik-dashboard-ingressroute.yaml and update it with your hostname, then apply: kubectl apply -f traefik-dashboard-secret.yaml kubectl apply -f traefik-dashboard-ingressroute.yaml This should create: A secret in Kubernetes cluster name traefik-dashboard-auth A middleware for Traefik name traefik-dashboard-basicauth An ingress route for Traefik name dashboard Check out the Traefik Dashboard with the URL you specify earlier. Exposing a service with traefik and Rancher Ingress In Rancher go to Load Balancing create ingress choose a host name (service.example.com) choose a target (your workload) set the port to the exposed port within the container go to labels and annotations and add kubernetes.io/ingress.class = traefik-external note, traefik-external comes from --providers.kubernetesingress.ingressclass=traefik-external in traefik-chart-values.yml.If you used something else, you will need to set your label properly. when you visit your website (https://service.example.com) you should now see a certificate issues.If it’s a staging cert, see the note about switching to production in traefik-chart-values.yaml.After changing, you will need to delete your certs in storage and reapply that file kubectl delete -n kube-system persistentvolumeclaims acme-json-certs kubectl apply -f traefik-config.yaml Exposing a service with traefik IngressRoute copy the contents of config-ingress-route/kubernetes to your local machine then run kubectl apply -f kubernetes This will create the deployment, service, and ingress.

I ended up tainting my storage nodes using this command kubectl taint nodes luna-01 luna-02 luna-03 luna-04 CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute kubectl taint nodes luna-01 luna-02 luna-03 luna-04 StorageOnly=true:NoExecute Then applying that toleration to Longhorn in settings StorageOnly=true:NoExecute;CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute This ensures that the storage nodes won’t take on any general workloads and still allow Lonhorn to use these as storage.
